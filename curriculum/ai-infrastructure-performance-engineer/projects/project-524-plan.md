- Executive briefing + rollout roadmap aligning with architect/principal programs.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Profile baseline LLM deployment and prioritize optimization opportunities.
- Implement attention optimizations, cache strategies, and hardware/compiler accelerations.
- Conduct accuracy/safety evaluations, cost modeling, and stakeholder briefings.

### Milestone Schedule

- Weeks 1-2: Baseline assessment, charter definition, stakeholder alignment.
- Weeks 3-4: Optimization iterations (kernels, batching, hardware) and benchmarking.
- Weeks 5-6: Validation, FinOps modeling, and documentation.
- Weeks 7-8: Executive readout, enablement, and backlog handoff.

## Assessment & Validation

- Optimization charter and benchmark findings reviewed by GPU platform and MLOps leads.
- Responsible AI and security approvals documented; governance board sign-off captured.
- Executive presentation delivered summarizing ROI, risks, and next steps.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/project-03-llm-inference`
- Solutions repo: `solutions/ai-infra-performance-solutions/project-03-llm-inference`
- Aligns with architect responsible AI roadmap and MLOps LLM reliability project (PROJ-555).
