# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer | Module 527 operationalizes performance management in production environments.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-527
- **Module Title**: Production Performance Operations
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer
- **Duration**: 34 hours (10 lecture, 14 lab, 6 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-523, MOD-526
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-523, leadership/principal performance initiatives

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with MLOps production operations (MOD-558) to reuse observability and incident workflows.
- Provides FinOps reporting frameworks consumed by ML Platform and leadership tracks.
- Coordinates with security to verify optimization changes do not introduce risk.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement performance observability dashboards, alerts, and SLOs for inference/training workloads.
- Conduct chaos and load testing to validate reliability of optimized deployments.
- Integrate performance reporting with business-facing FinOps metrics and executive communication.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| service-reliability | Proficient | Performance runbook & dashboard | AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer |
| finops | Working | Cost-performance report | AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Observability Integration** – GPU metrics (DCGM), application telemetry, business KPIs.
2. **Testing & Validation** – chaos experiments, load tests, failure injection, rollback drills.
3. **Runbooks & Incident Response** – escalation paths, communication templates, postmortems.
4. **FinOps Reporting** – cost attribution, ROI tracking, scenario modeling.
5. **Stakeholder Enablement** – dashboards, briefings, performance review cadences.

## Hands-On Activities

- Build composite dashboard combining DCGM, application, and cost metrics; define SLOs.
- Run chaos/load tests and update runbooks with mitigation strategies.
- Produce performance + cost report for leadership review with recommendations.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Dashboard and runbook evaluation with MLOps/Platform stakeholders.
- FinOps report presentation summarizing optimization outcomes.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Legacy source: `lessons/mod-007-production-deployment`
- Outputs reinforce PROJ-523 distributed inference optimization and feed leadership/principal reporting workflows.
