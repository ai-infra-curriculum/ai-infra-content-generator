# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer | Module 523 standardizes profiling and benchmarking automation practices.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-523
- **Module Title**: Profiling & Benchmark Automation
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer
- **Duration**: 34 hours (10 lecture, 16 lab, 6 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-521, MOD-522
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-525, MOD-527, PROJ-521

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with MLOps observability to reuse dashboards and alerting pipelines.
- Feeds performance data to ML Platform developer experience tooling for self-service benchmarks.
- Enables leadership/principal roles to consume standardized performance reports.

## Learning Objectives

- Build reproducible benchmarking harnesses with automated regression detection and alerting.
- Aggregate profiling data with infrastructure metrics to drive data-driven prioritization.
- Integrate benchmarking workflows into CI/CD and governance processes.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| pipeline-automation | Proficient | Benchmark automation pipeline | AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer |
| service-reliability | Working | Performance regression SLOs | AI Infrastructure Performance Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Benchmark Design Patterns** – workloads, repeatability, environment controls.
2. **Automation Tooling** – CI runners, containerized benchmarks, result storage.
3. **Regression Detection** – baselines, anomaly detection, notifications.
4. **Reporting & Dashboards** – Grafana/Looker integration, FinOps overlays.
5. **Governance Hooks** – promoting results to leadership, sign-off workflows.

## Hands-On Activities

- Create containerized benchmark job with automated comparison vs baseline.
- Configure regression detection and alerting integrated with MLOps observability.
- Publish performance dashboard reused in PROJ-521 and leadership reporting.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Benchmark automation pipeline demonstration and code review.
- Performance dashboard walkthrough with FinOps stakeholders.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Legacy source: `lessons/mod-003-performance-profiling`
- Outputs support PROJ-521 optimization pipeline and provide data for MOD-527 production operations.
