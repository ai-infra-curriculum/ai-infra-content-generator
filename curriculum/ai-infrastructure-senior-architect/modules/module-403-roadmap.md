# Module Roadmap

> Senior AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 403 strengthens enterprise architecture governance leadership.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-403
- **Module Title**: Enterprise Architecture Governance & Standards
- **Target Role(s)**: Senior AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 45 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 9 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-401, MOD-303
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-408, PROJ-502, PROJ-503

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Architect governance practices (MOD-303) and strategic vision (MOD-401).
- **Adds New Depth**: Enterprise-wide governance operating model, metrics, capability maturity.
- **Shared Assets**: Uses existing standards repositories, policy-as-code assets, and ADR catalogs.
- **Differentiators**: Focus on board-level governance, KPIs, and capability building across architecture teams.

## Learning Objectives

- Establish enterprise architecture governance structure, charter, and decision frameworks.
- Define standards lifecycle, knowledge management, and capability maturity models.
- Implement metrics and continuous improvement programs across the architecture community.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| governance-leadership | Expert | Governance charter & metrics dashboard | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |
| responsible-ai | Proficient | Integrated compliance & RAI governance plan | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. Governance operating models (federated vs centralized).
2. Architecture boards, exception handling, decision logging.
3. Standards lifecycle, templates, knowledge management.
4. Capability maturity assessments, training, and onboarding.
5. Metrics/KPIs, continuous improvement, tooling.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Governance charter & RACI | Approved by exec steering group | Governance review |
| Lab 2 | Metrics dashboard & maturity model | Tracks adoption, exceptions, ROI | Metrics audit |
| Lab 3 | Knowledge management plan | Includes community events & learning paths | Peer feedback |
| Assessment | Governance simulation | ≥80% score in board facilitation exercise | Simulation panel |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: Governance charters, metrics dashboards, training playbooks, exception logs.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-senior-architect/module-403-governance-standards/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Board simulation and metrics review required.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README, legacy governance frameworks.
- **Supplemental Resources**: TOGAF governance, COBIT, IT4IT, internal playbooks.
- **Tooling Requirements**: Knowledge base, metrics dashboards, survey tools, meeting facilitation tools.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Charter defines decision rights, cadence, integration with compliance/security.
- [ ] Metrics dashboard includes adoption, technical debt, ROI, and RAI indicators.
- [ ] Knowledge plan includes onboarding, guilds, and talent development.
- [ ] Deliverables support PROJ-502 and PROJ-503 governance requirements.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Align with compliance leads early to ensure governance artifacts satisfy audit needs.
