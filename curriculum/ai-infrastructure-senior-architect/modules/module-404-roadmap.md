# Module Roadmap

> Senior AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 404 leads innovation and R&D at enterprise scale.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-404
- **Module Title**: Innovation & R&D Leadership
- **Target Role(s)**: Senior AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 45 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 9 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-401, MOD-306
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-407, MOD-410, PROJ-504

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Architect platform strategy (MOD-306) and enterprise vision (MOD-401).
- **Adds New Depth**: Technology radar, incubation pipelines, IP management, funding models.
- **Shared Assets**: Uses platform artifacts, data strategy, and governance frameworks as innovation inputs.
- **Differentiators**: Emphasizes portfolio management, co-innovation, and measurable impact.

## Learning Objectives

- Build AI innovation framework (radar, intake, funding, metrics).
- Evaluate emerging technologies and run structured experiments/PoCs.
- Develop IP/patent strategy, partnership models, and executive reporting.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| innovation-strategy | Expert | Innovation operating model & KPI set | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |
| tech-evaluation | Expert | Technology radar & evaluation dossiers | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. Innovation strategy, portfolio governance, funding models.
2. Technology scouting, evaluation criteria, PoC design.
3. Incubation pipelines, venture collaboration, patent programs.
4. Metrics (time-to-value, adoption, ROI) and sustainability.
5. Communication with executives, boards, and external partners.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Technology radar & trends report | Reviewed with innovation council | Innovation review |
