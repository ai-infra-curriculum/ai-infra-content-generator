# Module Roadmap

> Senior AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 406 drives global infrastructure strategy and sustainability.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-406
- **Module Title**: Global Infrastructure & Sustainability
- **Target Role(s)**: Senior AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 50 hours (16 lecture, 20 lab, 10 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-205, MOD-302, MOD-304
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-502, MOD-410

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Architect multi-cloud, DR, and FinOps capabilities.
- **Adds New Depth**: Global topology, sovereignty, sustainability, geopolitical risk management.
- **Shared Assets**: Uses FinOps dashboards, DR runbooks, and governance templates.
- **Differentiators**: Focus on enterprise-wide global strategy, carbon accounting, and stakeholder reporting.

## Learning Objectives

- Design global AI infrastructure covering regions, sovereignty, DR, sustainability, and compliance.
- Balance cost/performance/carbon using advanced FinOps and sustainability metrics.
- Produce global platform roadmap and executive reporting for resilience and ESG commitments.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| global-platform-architecture | Expert | Global architecture dossier | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |
| sustainability-strategy | Proficient | ESG & carbon metrics plan | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. Global topology patterns (hub-and-spoke, cell-based, sovereign cloud).
2. Resilience & DR across regions, regulatory domains.
3. Sustainability metrics, carbon accounting, green AI strategies.
4. Performance/cost optimization across heterogeneous hardware.
5. Geopolitical risk, supply chain, crisis management.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Global architecture & sovereignty matrix | Reviewed by legal/compliance | Architecture review |
| Lab 2 | Resilience & DR plan | Chaos drill scenario documented | DR simulation |
| Lab 3 | Sustainability & FinOps model | Carbon/cost dashboards approved by FinOps team | FinOps review |
| Assessment | Global strategy briefing | ≥80% on executive panel rubric | Panel evaluation |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: Sovereignty matrices, DR runbooks, sustainability dashboards, risk registers.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-senior-architect/module-406-global-infrastructure/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Requires chaos/DR simulation and FinOps review.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README, legacy global infrastructure docs.
- **Supplemental Resources**: Cloud provider sovereignty whitepapers, sustainability frameworks (Green Software Foundation).
- **Tooling Requirements**: IaC, chaos tools, FinOps dashboards, ESG reporting platforms.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Architecture covers data residency, DR, compliance, cost, and carbon metrics.
- [ ] DR plan aligned with MOD-305 outputs and PROJ-502 requirements.
- [ ] Sustainability metrics integrated into FinOps dashboards.
- [ ] Executive briefing highlights risk/mitigation and investment plan.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Coordinate with responsible AI team (MOD-405) to ensure global policies reflect RAI commitments.
