# Module Roadmap

> Senior AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 405 scales responsible AI governance and ethics programs.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-405
- **Module Title**: Responsible AI & Ethics Leadership
- **Target Role(s)**: Senior AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-303, MOD-308
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-503, PROJ-505

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Architect compliance frameworks (MOD-303) and LLM architecture (MOD-308).
- **Adds New Depth**: Enterprise RAI governance, regulatory alignment, ethics risk management.
- **Shared Assets**: Leverages policy templates, audit evidence, safety plans from architect role.
- **Differentiators**: Focus on cross-functional councils, audit readiness, and public accountability.

## Learning Objectives

- Design responsible AI governance frameworks covering policy, risk assessment, and audit.
- Integrate bias monitoring, incident response, and red-team practices across AI lifecycle.
- Communicate ethics strategy to executives, regulators, and public forums.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| responsible-ai | Expert | RAI framework & risk register | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |
| compliance-governance | Expert | Audit-ready evidence & council charter | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. Regulatory landscape (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, sector-specific rules).
2. RAI operating model (council, processes, tooling, escalation).
3. Risk assessment, bias testing, red teaming, incident response.
4. Audit & evidence pipelines, transparency, documentation.
5. Communication & change management for ethics programs.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Responsible AI framework charter | Approved by compliance & legal stakeholders | Governance review |
| Lab 2 | Risk & mitigation plan | Bias tests, controls, escalation runbooks documented | Risk audit |
| Lab 3 | Audit evidence pipeline | Demonstrated evidence capture for multiple regulations | Compliance audit |
| Assessment | Ethics briefing | ≥80% on executive/ethics panel rubric | Panel evaluation |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: RAI framework templates, risk registers, audit evidence scripts, briefing decks.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-senior-architect/module-405-responsible-ai/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Requires audit simulation; record in validation tracker.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README, legacy ethics frameworks.
- **Supplemental Resources**: EU AI Act guidance, NIST AI RMF, industry ethics playbooks.
- **Tooling Requirements**: Policy-as-code, monitoring/analytics, incident management tools.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Framework defines roles, processes, escalation, metrics.
- [ ] Risk plan includes bias metrics, testing cadence, mitigation backlog.
- [ ] Evidence pipeline outputs auditable artifacts with timestamps.
- [ ] Deliverables integrate with PROJ-503 and PROJ-505.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Coordinate with legal/compliance for real-world policy validation and audit scheduling.
