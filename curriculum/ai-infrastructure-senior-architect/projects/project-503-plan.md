# Project Plan

> Senior AI Infrastructure Architect | Based on legacy Project 3 to create enterprise responsible AI framework.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-503
- **Project Title**: Responsible AI Framework
- **Target Role(s)**: Senior AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Placement in Curriculum**: After MOD-303, MOD-405, MOD-406
- **Estimated Duration**: 70 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-303 Enterprise Security & Compliance, MOD-405 Responsible AI, MOD-406 Global Infrastructure
- **Related Assessments**: Compliance audit simulation, ethics council briefing, risk register review

## Learning Objectives

- Build enterprise responsible AI governance covering policy, risk, monitoring, and audit.
- Integrate RAI controls into global infrastructure and platform operations.
- Produce executive and regulator-ready documentation, evidence, and communication plans.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| responsible-ai | Expert | RAI framework & evidence binder | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |
| compliance-governance | Expert | Audit report & remediation plan | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |
| global-platform-architecture | Proficient | Integration with global infrastructure | Senior AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Project Narrative

Executives require a comprehensive responsible AI framework covering all geographies and business units. You will:

1. Assess current policies, controls, and risk landscape across AI products.
2. Design RAI framework including governance structure, processes, and tooling.
3. Implement risk assessment, bias testing, incident response, and audit evidence workflows.
4. Integrate RAI controls with global infrastructure, data, and platform operations.
5. Present framework to ethics council, compliance leadership, and external regulators.

## Deliverables

- RAI framework charter (governance, processes, roles, metrics).
- Risk register, mitigation backlog, and bias testing plan.
- Audit evidence pipeline (policy-as-code, logs, reporting dashboards).
- Executive/regulator briefing package and communication plan.
- Integration map aligning RAI controls with platforms and data pipeline.

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Must align with EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, internal ethics policies.
- Provide evidence for at least two regulatory scenarios (e.g., healthcare & finance).
- Integrate with security, compliance, and data governance tooling.
- Deliver continuous improvement plan with metrics and accountability.

## Learner Experience

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time | Instructor Touchpoints |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Discover | Policy/risk assessment, stakeholder interviews | 12h | Ethics council workshop |
| Design | Framework, controls, integration, evidence pipelines | 44h | Compliance reviews |
| Validate | Audit simulation, executive/regulator briefings | 14h | Ethics & compliance panels |

## Solutions & Validation

- **Solutions Path**: `projects/ai-infrastructure-senior-architect/project-503-responsible-ai-framework/solutions`
- **Validation Profiles**: `python-strict`, compliance audit checklist, responsible AI review
