- Communicate technical strategy to executives and stakeholders through compelling narratives.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| technical-strategy | Proficient | Strategic roadmap & KPI presentation | Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer |
| mentorship | Expert | Mentorship plan & peer feedback | Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. Leadership models for infrastructure teams (servant leadership, situational leadership).
2. Strategic planning (roadmaps, OKRs, KPI dashboards, budget alignment).
3. Communication artifacts (ADRs, executive briefs, public updates, documentation standards).
4. Mentorship frameworks (skill matrices, growth plans, feedback loops, performance coaching).
5. Stakeholder management (product/security alignment, negotiation, conflict resolution).
6. Knowledge sharing (tech talks, internal blogs, open source/community engagement).

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Architectural decision record | ADR approved in design review | Peer review rubric |
| Lab 2 | Mentorship engagement | Documented plan + feedback from mentee | Peer feedback |
| Lab 3 | Executive briefing | Presentation delivered with action items | Stakeholder survey |
| Assessment | Leadership portfolio | Evaluated ≥ 80% by leadership panel | Portfolio review |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: ADR templates, mentorship plan examples, executive briefing deck, feedback forms.
- **Repository Strategy**: Stored as documentation assets (no code) in module solutions directory.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/senior-ai-infrastructure-engineer/module-210-technical-leadership/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Requires review process instead of automated tests; document evidence tracked.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README, leadership exercises, templates.
- **Supplemental Resources**: Google eng leadership materials, DevOps leadership guides, Radical Candor, NTSB-style postmortem references.
- **Tooling Requirements**: Collaboration tools (Docs, Slides), documentation generators, feedback collection platform.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] ADRs stored in shared repo with decision logs and follow-up.
- [ ] Mentorship plan includes success metrics and cadence.
- [ ] Executive briefing captures business impact, risk, and asks.
- [ ] Portfolio ties leadership actions to project outcomes (e.g., PROJ-304).

## Dependencies & Notes

- Encourage alignment with organization leadership to ensure deliverables slot into existing governance processes.
