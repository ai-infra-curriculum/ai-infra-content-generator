# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 306 scales MLOps platforms for enterprise-wide adoption.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-306
- **Module Title**: Enterprise MLOps Platform Architecture
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 55 hours (18 lecture, 24 lab, 10 project, 3 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-301, MOD-206, MOD-304
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-401, PROJ-402, PROJ-404

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Senior MLOps automation (MOD-206) and enterprise architecture foundations (MOD-301).
- **Adds New Depth**: Platform product thinking, governance, experimentation, and lifecycle automation at scale.
- **Shared Assets**: Extends platform APIs and templates from senior solutions; integrates FinOps metrics.
- **Differentiators**: Focus on multi-tenant architecture, compliance-aware pipelines, and stakeholder enablement.

## Learning Objectives

- Architect enterprise MLOps platforms with feature store, experimentation, registry, and deployment tooling.
- Implement governance frameworks (approvals, lineage, audit) and productize platform APIs/SDKs.
- Align platform roadmaps with business value, usage analytics, and user experience metrics.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| enterprise-mlops-architecture | Expert | Platform architecture blueprint & API design | AI Infrastructure Architect |
| platform-governance | Expert | Governance workflows & enablement plan | AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. **Platform Vision & Personas** – capability mapping, user journeys, KPIs.
2. **Architecture Components** – feature store, pipeline orchestration, registry, serving gateways.
3. **Governance & Compliance** – approvals, policy-as-code, lineage, audit integration.
4. **Platform Interfaces** – APIs, SDKs, CLI, developer portal, onboarding experiences.
5. **Operations & Support** – SLOs, incident response, usage analytics, feedback loops.
6. **Business Alignment** – adoption metrics, ROI tracking, roadmap prioritization.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Platform capability canvas | Personas, KPIs, architecture sketches | Product review |
| Lab 2 | Governance workflow | Approval pipeline with policy-as-code & audit logs | Compliance review |
| Lab 3 | API/SDK prototype | Working interface + docs & developer portal entry | DX review |
| Assessment | Platform strategy pitch | ≥80% on stakeholder evaluation rubric | Executive panel |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: Capability canvases, API specs, governance templates, enablement materials.
- **Repository Strategy**: Refer to `solutions/ai-infrastructure-architect/frameworks/` and `projects/project-401-enterprise-mlops-platform`.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-architect/module-306-enterprise-mlops/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Manual review and platform demo; align with validation backlog.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README, legacy platform architecture docs.
- **Supplemental Resources**: Backstage developer portal, Feast, MLflow, Dataiku/SageMaker reference architectures.
- **Tooling Requirements**: API design tools, documentation generators, analytics instrumentation, backlog management tool.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Capability canvas links architecture to personas and KPIs.
- [ ] Governance workflow integrates security/compliance requirements from MOD-303.
- [ ] API/SDK prototypes pass usability review with target personas.
- [ ] Strategy pitch references FinOps data and adoption plan.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Coordinate with leadership module (MOD-309) for communication coaching before stakeholder pitch.
