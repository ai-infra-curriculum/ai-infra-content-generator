# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Architect | Adapted from legacy Module 301 with updated governance and communication expectations (2025).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-301
- **Module Title**: Enterprise Architecture Fundamentals
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 50 hours (16 lecture, 20 lab, 10 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-210, MOD-201
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-302, MOD-306, MOD-309

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Senior-level leadership (MOD-210) and Kubernetes platform expertise (MOD-201).
- **Adds New Depth**: Enterprise architecture frameworks, governance programs, ADR stewardship.
- **Shared Assets**: Reuses ADR templates and review formats established in senior projects.
- **Differentiators**: Emphasis on business alignment, value stream mapping, and architecture boards.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply TOGAF/Zachman to define enterprise AI/ML reference architectures and capability maps.
- Establish architecture governance (boards, roadmaps, standards) and produce executive-ready documentation.
- Facilitate stakeholder alignment sessions and document decisions via ADRs and business cases.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| enterprise-architecture | Expert | Architecture dossier & ADR set | AI Infrastructure Architect |
| governance-leadership | Proficient | Governance charter & stakeholder feedback | AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. **Enterprise Architecture Foundations** – TOGAF ADM, capability maps, value streams.
2. **Reference Architecture Patterns** – layered AI platform views, cataloging reusable assets.
3. **Governance & Standards** – review boards, playbooks, exception processes, KPIs.
4. **Documentation Excellence** – C4/CPO diagrams, ADRs, stakeholder matrices, business cases.
5. **Stakeholder Engagement** – facilitation, negotiation, conflict resolution.
6. **Measurement & ROI** – architecture health metrics, cost-benefit analysis, roadmap tracking.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | Capability & value stream mapping | Executive summary reviewed by product/finance | Peer/exec review |
| Lab 2 | Reference architecture portfolio | Includes logical, physical, security views with ADRs | Architecture review |
| Lab 3 | Governance charter | Charter ratified by simulated board session | Stakeholder feedback |
| Assessment | Architecture communication defense | ≥80% score on presentation rubric | Panel evaluation |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: Architecture templates, governance charter samples, ADR examples, presentation decks.
- **Repository Strategy**: Solutions curated in `architecture-templates/` and `frameworks/` within `solutions/ai-infrastructure-architect`.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-architect/module-301-enterprise-architecture/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Requires peer review simulation; no automated tests.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**:
  - Module README within `modules/ai-infrastructure-architect/module-301-enterprise-architecture/README.md`
  - Legacy docs (`lessons/mod-301-enterprise-architecture`)
- **Supplemental Resources**:
  - TOGAF 9.2 documentation, CNCF AI reference architectures
  - Business architecture guild playbooks
- **Tooling Requirements**:
  - Diagram tools (PlantUML, Miro, Lucidchart), ADR tooling, collaboration suite

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Architecture dossier reviewed by at least two stakeholder personas.
- [ ] Governance charter defines decision rights, cadence, and metrics.
- [ ] ADRs capture trade-offs with clear business impact statements.
- [ ] Outputs inform PROJ-401 discovery packet.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Coordinate with leadership module (MOD-309) to rehearse executive storytelling before final assessment.
