# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 309 focuses on communication, influence, and governance leadership.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-309
- **Module Title**: Architecture Communication & Leadership
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-301, MOD-210
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-310, PROJ-401–405 executive reviews

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Enterprise architecture (MOD-301) and senior leadership skills (MOD-210).

## Learning Objectives

- Craft compelling executive narratives for AI architecture initiatives and investment requests.
- Facilitate architecture review boards, negotiate trade-offs, and document decisions effectively.
- Mentor architects/senior engineers and build communities of practice around architectural standards.

## Competency Alignment

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: Presentation templates, facilitation guides, mentorship playbooks, communication plans.
- **Repository Strategy**: Stored in `solutions/ai-infrastructure-architect/guides` and `resources/`.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-architect/module-309-arch-communication/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Requires peer/executive feedback loop; no automated tests.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README, legacy leadership materials.
- **Supplemental Resources**: Gartner architecture communication guides, storytelling books, change management frameworks.
- **Tooling Requirements**: Presentation tools, collaboration platforms, feedback survey tooling.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Executive deck ties architecture to business KPIs and strategic objectives.
- [ ] Governance facilitation logs include decisions, actions, and follow-up.
- [ ] Mentorship plan features measurable goals and cadence.
- [ ] Portfolio references outputs from modules/projets for real context.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Encourage coordination with PROJ-401–405 deliverables to rehearse real project briefings.
