# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 304 levels up FinOps capability across AI/ML platforms.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-304
- **Module Title**: Cost Optimization & FinOps
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 45 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 9 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-302, MOD-205
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-305, MOD-306, PROJ-401

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Senior FinOps practices and multi-cloud architecture decisions (MOD-205, MOD-302).
- **Adds New Depth**: Executive cost modeling, chargeback/showback, GPU fleet economics, sustainability metrics.
- **Shared Assets**: Extends FinOps dashboards shared with MOD-302 and PROJ-401.
- **Differentiators**: Focus on strategic financial management and business case development for AI portfolios.

## Learning Objectives

- Build cost transparency dashboards, budgets, and optimization levers for AI infrastructure.
- Design chargeback/showback models aligning consumption with business units.
- Produce business cases demonstrating ROI, cost avoidance, and sustainability metrics.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| finops-governance | Expert | FinOps operating model & KPI dashboard | AI Infrastructure Architect |
| cost-optimization | Expert | Optimization playbook with quantified savings | AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Content Outline

1. **FinOps Frameworks** – FinOps Foundation practices, operating models, stakeholder roles.
2. **Cost Transparency** – tagging, allocation, unit economics, GPU/accelerator costing.
3. **Optimization Levers** – rightsizing, reservations, workload placement, sustainability metrics.
4. **Chargeback/Showback** – pricing models, policy design, executive reporting.
5. **Business Case Development** – ROI modeling, sensitivity analysis, risk-adjusted decisions.
6. **Automation & Guardrails** – anomaly detection, budgets, policy-as-code, self-service tooling.

## Practical Components

| Asset | Description | Completion Criteria | Linked Validation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lab 1 | FinOps KPI dashboard | Real-time dashboard with unit costs and variance alerts | Dashboard review |
| Lab 2 | Optimization playbook | Documented actions achieving ≥30% projected savings | Financial review |
| Lab 3 | Chargeback policy pack | Pricing model + communication plan approved by finance | Stakeholder feedback |
| Assessment | Executive business case defense | ≥80% score on ROI presentation rubric | Finance/exec panel |

## Solutions Plan

- **Coverage**: Cost dashboards, optimization worksheets, chargeback templates, presentation decks.
- **Repository Strategy**: Assets stored in `solutions/ai-infrastructure-architect/frameworks/` and `resources/`.
- **Solution Path**: `modules/ai-infrastructure-architect/module-304-cost-finops/solutions`.
- **Validation Status**: Manual financial review; integrate with FinOps tooling where available.

## Resource Plan

- **Primary References**: Module README and legacy FinOps materials.
- **Supplemental Resources**: FinOps Foundation guides, cloud provider cost tools, sustainability frameworks.
- **Tooling Requirements**: Cloud cost APIs, BI tools (Looker/Tableau/PowerBI), spreadsheets, budgeting software.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Dashboards include cost, utilization, carbon, and anomaly metrics with targets.
- [ ] Optimization playbook ties actions to business units and risk mitigation.
- [ ] Chargeback/showback model validated with product and finance stakeholders.
- [ ] Materials feed PROJ-401 business case.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Align cost models with security/compliance investments from MOD-303 and resiliency designs from MOD-305.
