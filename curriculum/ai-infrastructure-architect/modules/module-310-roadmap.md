# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Architect | Module 310 explores emerging technologies and innovation strategy for AI platforms.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-310
- **Module Title**: Emerging Technologies & Innovation
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-309, MOD-308
- **Next Module(s)**: Innovation initiatives, PROJ-405 executive briefings

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On**: Communication/leadership (MOD-309) and LLM platform expertise (MOD-308).
- **Adds New Depth**: Technology radar creation, innovation pipeline, sustainability, vendor strategy.
- **Shared Assets**: Reuses architecture artefacts to evaluate emerging enhancements.
- **Differentiators**: Emphasizes strategic foresight, experimentation portfolio, and executive advising.

## Learning Objectives

- Evaluate emerging AI/ML technologies (hardware, edge, federated, sustainable AI) for enterprise adoption.
- Design innovation frameworks (technology radar, incubation pipeline, KPIs) aligning with business strategy.
- Produce executive advisory briefs with risk, opportunity, and investment recommendations.
