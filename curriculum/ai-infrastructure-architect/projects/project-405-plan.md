# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure Architect | Adapted from legacy Project 5 to deliver enterprise security and compliance frameworks for AI.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-405
- **Project Title**: Security & Compliance Framework
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Architect
- **Placement in Curriculum**: After MOD-303, MOD-305, MOD-308, MOD-309
- **Estimated Duration**: 60 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-303 Security & Compliance Architecture, MOD-305 HA & DR, MOD-308 LLM Architecture, MOD-309 Communication & Leadership
- **Related Assessments**: Compliance audit simulation, executive security briefing, responsible AI review

## Learning Objectives

- Architect comprehensive security and compliance framework for regulated AI workloads (e.g., HIPAA, SOC 2).
- Implement policy automation, evidence collection, and responsible AI governance.
- Deliver executive security briefing and roadmap prioritizing risk mitigation and investment.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| security-architecture | Expert | Security architecture & runbooks | AI Infrastructure Architect |
| compliance-governance | Expert | Audit-ready evidence & policy automation | AI Infrastructure Architect |
| responsible-ai | Proficient | RAI policy & incident response plan | AI Infrastructure Architect |

## Project Narrative

Operating in a highly regulated industry, the company must ensure AI platforms meet stringent compliance mandates. You will:

1. Assess regulatory landscape, risk appetite, and existing control gaps.
2. Design security architecture covering identity, data protection, monitoring, and incident response.
3. Build compliance automation (policy-as-code, evidence pipelines) and responsible AI guardrails.
4. Develop risk register, remediation roadmap, and executive communication plan.
5. Present framework to CISO/CIO and lead tabletop exercise to validate preparedness.

## Deliverables

- Security architecture dossier (control catalog, threat model, incident workflows).
- Compliance automation toolkit (policies, audit evidence scripts, reporting dashboards).
- Responsible AI policy pack (guardrails, bias monitoring, red-team procedure).
- Risk register with prioritised remediation backlog and investment plan.
- Executive briefing deck with roadmap, KPIs, and decision requests.

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Align with industry regulations (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, EU AI Act) and corporate policies.
- Integrate with existing SIEM, IAM, secrets management, and incident tooling.
- Provide test evidence via audit simulation/tabletop exercises.
- Architecture must support multi-cloud deployment scenarios defined in PROJ-402.

## Learner Experience

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time | Instructor Touchpoints |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Discover | Regulation mapping, risk assessment, stakeholder interviews | 8h | Security council sync |
| Design | Architecture, automation, RAI framework, roadmap | 38h | Weekly governance reviews |
| Validate | Audit simulation, executive briefing, tabletop exercise | 14h | CISO rehearsal |

## Solutions & Validation

- **Solutions Path**: `projects/ai-infrastructure-architect/project-405-security-framework/solutions`
- **Validation Profiles**: `python-strict`, compliance audit checklist, tabletop validation log
- **Automation Hooks**: See `solutions/ai-infrastructure-architect/resources/security` for policy templates

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Regulatory misinterpretation**: Work with legal/compliance stakeholders; maintain regulatory traceability matrix.
- **Automation gaps**: Prioritize policy-as-code and evidence pipelines; document manual fallbacks.
- **Stakeholder buy-in**: Provide clear ROI, risk reduction metrics, and change management plan.
