risk_register:
- risk: Limited access to executive stakeholders may hinder realistic board simulations.
  impact: medium
  likelihood: medium
  mitigation: Use cross-functional role-play sessions and pre-recorded executive feedback.
- risk: Multi-cloud cost and DR simulations may require tooling beyond sandbox.
  impact: high
  likelihood: medium
  mitigation: Provide financial models, automation templates, and documented assumptions for offline validation.
