# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Modernizes legacy `projects/project-2-model-serving` with shared observability assets.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-552
- **Project Title**: Model Serving & Observability Platform
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Follows MOD-552, MOD-553, MOD-558
- **Estimated Duration**: 120 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-552, MOD-553, MOD-558
- **Related Assessments**: Observability dashboard evaluation, incident simulation

## Learning Objectives

- Deploy a scalable model serving stack (batch + real-time) with SLO-driven observability.
- Integrate drift monitoring, alerting, and incident response workflows.
- Share dashboards and runbooks with platform and security teams to prevent duplicate tooling.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| model-observability | Expert | Monitoring dashboards & alerts | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| service-reliability | Expert | Incident tabletop deliverables | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| automation | Proficient | Serving deployment pipelines | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Key Deliverables

- Serving infrastructure (KServe/Seldon + autoscaling + rollout controls).
- Observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana, Evidently) with unified dashboards.
- Incident response playbooks and postmortem templates.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Infrastructure design session leveraging platform serving templates.
- Observability instrumentation lab integrating ML metrics and FinOps signals.
- Chaos drill tabletop with SRE/security observers.

### Milestone Schedule

- Weeks 1-2: Architecture & environment setup.
- Weeks 3-4: Serving + observability implementation.
- Weeks 5-6: Incident response drills and documentation.

## Assessment & Validation

- Observability review with SRE leadership ensuring reuse of shared dashboards.
- Incident simulation run with platform + security teams.
- Postmortem capturing corrective actions and alignment with governance module.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/project-2-model-serving`
- Solutions repository: `solutions/ai-infra-mlops-solutions/project-2-model-serving`
- Outputs feed PROJ-555 (LLMOps reliability) and architect MLOps initiatives.
