# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Evolves legacy `projects/project-5-llmops` into an org-wide reliability program.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-555
- **Project Title**: LLMOps Reliability Program
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Follows MOD-558, MOD-559, MOD-560
- **Estimated Duration**: 150 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-558, MOD-559, MOD-560
- **Related Assessments**: LLMOps charter review, cost & safety evaluation

## Learning Objectives

- Operationalize LLM delivery with evaluation harnesses, safety controls, and cost guardrails.
- Integrate governance, responsible AI, and compliance requirements into high-velocity LLM experimentation.
- Align deliverables with architect/principal portfolios to ensure enterprise readiness.

## Competency Alignment
