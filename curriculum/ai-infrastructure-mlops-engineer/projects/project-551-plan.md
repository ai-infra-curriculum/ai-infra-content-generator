# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Built on legacy `projects/project-1-ml-pipeline` implementation.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-551
- **Project Title**: End-to-End ML Pipeline Modernization
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Follows MOD-551, MOD-552, MOD-555
- **Estimated Duration**: 140 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-551, MOD-552, MOD-555
- **Related Assessments**: Pipeline architecture review, automation demo

## Learning Objectives

- Refactor the legacy ML pipeline to align with standardized CI/CD, experiment tracking, and promotion workflows.
- Automate retraining, validation, and deployment with GitOps and governance checkpoints.
- Produce operational documentation that downstream teams (platform, security) can reuse.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| pipeline-automation | Expert | CI/CD + GitOps rollout | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| experiment-tracking | Proficient | Reproducibility report | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| model-lifecycle | Proficient | Promotion playbooks | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Key Deliverables

- Automated pipeline templates covering training, evaluation, deployment, rollback.
- Experiment tracking configuration with reproducibility checks and approvals.
- Operational runbooks and documentation for hand-off to platform/security teams.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Architecture design review comparing legacy vs modernized pipeline.
- Implementation sprints for CI/CD, experiment tracking, and promotion stages.
- Governance integration workshop with compliance and security partners.

### Milestone Schedule

- Weeks 1-2: Requirements & architecture alignment.
- Weeks 3-4: CI/CD + experiment tracking implementation.
- Weeks 5-6: Promotion workflow, governance, and documentation.
- Week 7: Final review and stakeholder walkthrough.

## Assessment & Validation

- Peer review of pipeline design by senior engineer and platform counterparts.
- Demo of automated retraining and rollback using GitOps.
- Documentation audit ensuring evidence captured for governance module.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/project-1-ml-pipeline`
- Links to solutions repo: `solutions/ai-infra-mlops-solutions/project-1-ml-pipeline`
- Provides baseline code reused in PROJ-552 and PROJ-553 to minimize duplication.
