# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Aligns with legacy `projects/project-3-experimentation` and new governance requirements.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-553
- **Project Title**: Experimentation & Data Quality Hub
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Follows MOD-554, MOD-555
- **Estimated Duration**: 110 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-554, MOD-555
- **Related Assessments**: Experiment reproducibility audit, data lineage review

## Learning Objectives

- Deliver a centralized experimentation hub integrating tracking, metadata, and governance policies.
- Automate data quality validation, lineage capture, and promotion approvals.
- Share artefacts with platform feature store teams to eliminate duplicate metadata management.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| experiment-tracking | Expert | Experiment governance report | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| data-governance | Proficient | Lineage & validation dashboards | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Key Deliverables

- Experiment tracking portal (MLflow/W&B) with reproducibility guarantees.
- Data quality validation pipelines with lineage dashboards.
- Governance workflow integrating approvals and bias checks.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Metadata modelling workshop with data platform + ML Platform stakeholders.
- Validation automation lab leveraging shared templates from feature store module.
- Governance review simulation with compliance and architect roles.

### Milestone Schedule

- Weeks 1-2: Requirements gathering & architecture.
- Weeks 3-4: Implementation of tracking + validation components.
- Weeks 5-6: Governance workflows and stakeholder review.

## Assessment & Validation

- Reproducibility audit run by senior engineer + platform leads.
- Governance evidence pack accepted by compliance stakeholders.
- Documentation added to shared knowledge base for reuse by other roles.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/project-3-experimentation`
- Solutions repository: `solutions/ai-infra-mlops-solutions/project-3-experimentation`
- Outputs feed compliance pipeline (PROJ-554) and LLMOps reliability (PROJ-555).
