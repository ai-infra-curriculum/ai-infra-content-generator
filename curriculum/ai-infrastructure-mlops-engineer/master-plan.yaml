  impact: medium
  likelihood: medium
  mitigation: Provide containerized sandboxes, mock services, and cloud credits where possible.
- risk: Overlap with ML Platform track could cause duplication or confusion.
  impact: medium
  likelihood: low
  mitigation: Cross-link shared assets, highlight differentiation, and reuse templates explicitly.
