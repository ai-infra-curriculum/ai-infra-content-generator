# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Module 558 recontextualizes `lessons/08-production-ops` with shared SRE tooling.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-558
- **Module Title**: Production Operations & SRE for ML
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 18 lab, 6 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-553, MOD-556
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-559, MOD-560, PROJ-552, PROJ-555

## Cross-Role Progression

- Builds on senior engineer reliability practices (MOD-207) while adding ML-specific runbooks.
- Shares observability dashboards with ML Platform and FinOps teams to prevent duplicate instrumentation.
- Provides runbooks for team lead and principal engineer leadership modules.

## Learning Objectives

- Define reliability targets, runbooks, and operational cadences tailored to ML services and batch pipelines.
- Integrate chaos testing, load testing, and incident drills into automation pipelines.
- Coordinate post-incident processes with security and governance teams for holistic responses.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| service-reliability | Expert | Runbook & SLO review | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| incident-response | Expert | Incident simulation & postmortem | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Reliability Strategy** – SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, prioritization.
2. **Operational Tooling** – on-call, alert routing, collaboration platforms.
3. **Testing Practices** – chaos, load, failover drills specific to ML.
4. **Incident Command** – roles, communications, escalation, retrospectives.
5. **Continuous Improvement** – metrics, feedback loops, shared dashboards.

## Hands-On Activities

- Build reliability scorecard aligning with platform observability outputs.
- Run chaos experiments on pipelines and document mitigation strategies.
- Conduct tabletop exercise with security/compliance observers to ensure holistic response.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Reliability review with SRE leadership.
- Post-incident report including actions for platform and governance teams.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Uses ML Platform observability stack (MOD-508) to avoid duplicate instrumentation.
- Supplies runbooks referenced by leadership and architect tracks for escalation planning.
