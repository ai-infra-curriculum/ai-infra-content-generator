# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Module 551 aligns legacy `lessons/01-mlops-foundations` with the new multi-role program.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-551
- **Module Title**: MLOps Foundations
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Duration**: 30 hours (10 lecture, 14 lab, 4 portfolio, 2 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-201, MOD-206
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-552, MOD-553, PROJ-551

## Cross-Role Progression

- Reuses automation baselines from Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer (MOD-206) to minimize duplicate teaching.
- Establishes terminology and lifecycle expectations leveraged by ML Platform (MOD-501) and architect LLM programs.
- Introduces governance hooks referencing security track modules (MOD-907+) early to align expectations.

## Learning Objectives

- Articulate the end-to-end ML lifecycle, stakeholders, and operational contracts.
- Inventory existing automation, observability, and governance assets from earlier tracks.
- Define an MLOps operating model that scales across teams and prepares for specialization.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| pipeline-automation | Working | Lifecycle blueprint & RACI | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| model-lifecycle | Working | Operating model presentation | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Lifecycle Overview** – research to production, actors, and handoffs.
2. **Tooling Landscape** – inventory current pipelines, registries, observability.
3. **Governance Touchpoints** – approvals, responsible AI, security alignment.
4. **Operating Model** – roles, cadences, metrics.
5. **Roadmap Alignment** – identify quick wins and dependencies on platform/security roles.

## Hands-On Activities

- Map existing pipelines and tooling to identify duplication opportunities.
- Workshop to align stakeholders on terminology and operating cadences.
- Draft MLOps charter summarizing scope, success metrics, and shared assets.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Lifecycle blueprint with stakeholder alignment notes.
- MLOps charter reviewed with platform and security counterparts.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Connects to senior engineer playbooks and ML Platform architecture documents.
- Provides baseline artefacts reused in governance (MOD-557) and LLMOps (MOD-560).
