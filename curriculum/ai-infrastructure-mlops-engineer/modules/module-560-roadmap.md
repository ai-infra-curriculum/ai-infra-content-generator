# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Module 560 reframes `lessons/10-advanced-topics` as an LLMOps and future-state capstone.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-560
- **Module Title**: Advanced Topics & LLMOps
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Duration**: 38 hours (10 lecture, 16 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-558, MOD-559
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-555, architect PROJ-405

## Cross-Role Progression

- Bridges to architect and principal engineer LLM programs to keep advanced content aligned.
- Reuses ML Platform capability templates (developer experience, observability) for LLM workloads.
- Provides guidance for team lead/principal engineer tracks on scaling responsible AI initiatives.

## Learning Objectives

- Operationalize LLM workloads with evaluation harnesses, guardrails, and cost management.
- Extend automation, monitoring, and governance patterns to multi-model, multi-modal environments.
- Prepare roadmap for next-generation MLOps capabilities across the organization.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| llmops | Expert | LLMOps operating plan | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| innovation | Expert | Future-state capability roadmap | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **LLMOps Overview** – evaluation, safety, iteration speed.
2. **Automation Patterns** – prompt pipelines, evaluation harnesses, human feedback loops.
3. **Observability & Cost** – telemetry, caching, optimization, budget management.
4. **Governance & Risk** – policy updates, responsible AI, legal implications.
5. **Strategic Roadmapping** – aligning with architect/principal programs, investment planning.

## Hands-On Activities

- Implement evaluation harness referencing shared templates from architect LLM initiative.
- Configure cost dashboards and guardrails to track LLM usage.
- Draft future-state roadmap aligning with executive priorities and platform dependencies.

## Assessments & Evidence

- LLMOps program charter reviewed with architect/principal stakeholders.
- Cost and governance plan approved by finance/compliance partners.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Builds on advanced experimentation outputs (MOD-555) and governance frameworks (MOD-557).
- Supplies forward-looking artefacts for architect/principal capstones to avoid revisiting fundamentals.
