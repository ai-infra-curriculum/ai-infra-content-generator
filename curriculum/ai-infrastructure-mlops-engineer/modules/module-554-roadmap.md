# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer | Module 554 reframes `lessons/04-data-quality` with enterprise lineage and governance linkage.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-554
- **Module Title**: Data Quality & Lineage Automation
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer
- **Duration**: 38 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 6 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-105, MOD-552
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-555, MOD-557, PROJ-553

## Cross-Role Progression

- Builds on engineer data pipeline module (MOD-105) and senior governance to reduce redundant lessons.
- Shares validation templates with ML Platform feature store module (MOD-504).
- Supplies evidence for architect governance initiatives (MOD-603) and security compliance modules.

## Learning Objectives

- Automate data quality checks (schema, distribution, anomaly) integrated into CI/CD workflows.
- Capture lineage metadata and audit evidence across batch and streaming pipelines.
- Coordinate with data platform teams to reuse validation frameworks and avoid duplication.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| data-governance | Proficient | Validation + lineage report | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |
| pipeline-automation | Proficient | CI pipeline with quality gates | AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Data Quality Taxonomy** – checks, ownership, remediation.
2. **Validation Frameworks** – Great Expectations, TFDV, custom checks.
3. **Lineage Capture** – metadata stores, OpenLineage, integration with registries.
4. **Governance Evidence** – packaging quality results for audits.
5. **Collaboration Patterns** – working with data engineering & platform teams.

## Hands-On Activities

- Implement validation suite applied automatically in CI and orchestrated workflows.
- Capture lineage metadata and surface through shared dashboards.
- Draft governance evidence pack reused by compliance module (MOD-557).

## Assessments & Evidence

- Review of automated validation pipeline with stakeholders.
- Governance evidence bundle accepted by security/compliance reviewers.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Aligns with feature store governance to keep quality logic centralized.
- Provides lineage data reused in architect-level portfolio reviews.
