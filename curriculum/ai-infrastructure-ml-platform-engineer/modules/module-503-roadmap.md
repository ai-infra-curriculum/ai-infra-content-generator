# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 503 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-503-multi-tenancy).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-503
- **Module Title**: Multi-Tenancy & Resource Governance
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-501, MOD-502
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-504, PROJ-502, PROJ-506

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with security and FinOps teams to centralize quota and governance frameworks.
- Shares resource governance patterns with principal engineer and architect tracks.
- Feeds compliance automation modules with tenant-level policy requirements.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement tenant isolation, quotas, and policy enforcement across compute/storage.
- Model cost allocation, chargeback/showback, and resource analytics.
- Design tenant lifecycle processes (onboarding, change, retirement).

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| multi-tenancy | Advanced | Tenant isolation & quota design | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| capacity-planning | Advanced | Cost governance dashboard | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Tenant Models** – isolation strategies, namespaces, resource pools.
2. **Quota Management** – limits, elasticity, approvals.
3. **Cost Governance** – budgets, reporting, optimization.
4. **Lifecycle** – onboarding, change control, off-boarding.
5. **Policy Integration** – guardrails, compliance, audits.

## Hands-On Activities

- Tenant modeling lab with representative personas.
- Cost analytics workshop building FinOps dashboards.
- Policy gate simulation for tenant change requests.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Tenant governance plan with cost & policy metrics.
- Lifecycle process documentation with SOPs.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Governance plans reused by security and compliance automation modules.
- Cost dashboards integrated with leadership reporting.
