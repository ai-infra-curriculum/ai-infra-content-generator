# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 504 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-504-feature-store).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-504
- **Module Title**: Feature Store Engineering
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 42 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 portfolio, 6 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-503
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-505, MOD-506, PROJ-502

## Cross-Role Progression

- Collaborates with data engineering and governance teams to avoid duplicate ingestion pipelines.
- Shares feature store APIs with workflow/orchestration and developer experience modules.
- Feeds principal architect data platform strategies with reusable templates.

## Learning Objectives

- Build feature ingestion pipelines with point-in-time correctness and lineage.
- Design serving APIs and caching strategies for online inference.
- Implement governance (metadata, approvals, quality gates) for features.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| feature-platform | Advanced | Feature store architecture & governance plan | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| data-engineering | Advanced | Ingestion pipelines & quality checks | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Feature Lifecycle** – creation, validation, deployment.
2. **Architecture** – storage, serving, online/offline sync.
3. **Governance** – metadata, lineage, approvals.
4. **Performance** – caching, latency optimization, scaling.
5. **Integration** – pipelines, notebooks, model training.

## Hands-On Activities

- Feature pipeline lab implementing ingestion/backfill.
- Serving API design workshop with product consumers.
- Governance review simulation with data compliance stakeholders.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Feature platform architecture design pack.
- Governance checklist and lineage report.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping
