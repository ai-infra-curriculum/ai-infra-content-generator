# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 501 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-501-platform-fundamentals).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-501
- **Module Title**: ML Platform Fundamentals
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 46 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 6 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-201, MOD-206
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-502, MOD-503, PROJ-501

## Cross-Role Progression

- Builds on infrastructure engineer automation and MLOps foundations to introduce platform-first thinking.
- Provides shared platform architecture assets used by principal engineer and architect tracks.
- Avoids duplication by sourcing baseline guardrails from security/DevOps playbooks.

## Learning Objectives

- Define ML platform architecture, service catalog, and tenancy models.
- Establish platform roadmaps, stakeholder alignment, and product metrics.
- Document operational standards and governance expectations for downstream modules.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| ml-platform-architecture | Advanced | Platform architecture blueprint | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| service-design | Advanced | Service catalog & operating model | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Platform Vision** – scope, personas, value metrics.
2. **Architecture Foundations** – control/data planes, abstractions.
3. **Tenancy & Governance** – isolation, quotas, policies.
4. **Roadmap & Stakeholders** – alignment, prioritization, funding.
5. **Operational Standards** – SLOs, runbooks, readiness criteria.

## Hands-On Activities

- Platform vision workshop with product and research partners.
- Architecture review session producing reference diagrams.
- Tenancy design lab modeling quotas and isolation policies.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Platform architecture blueprint and operating model.
- Stakeholder alignment packet with roadmap summary.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Blueprint reused by principal engineer capstone to ensure alignment.
- Operating model referenced by team lead leadership modules.
