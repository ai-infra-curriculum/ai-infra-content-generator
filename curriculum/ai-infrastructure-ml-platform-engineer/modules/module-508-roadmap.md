# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 508 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-508-observability).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-508
- **Module Title**: Platform Observability & FinOps
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 42 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 project, 6 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-505, MOD-507
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-503, PROJ-505, PROJ-506

## Cross-Role Progression

- Collaborates with SRE, FinOps, and security teams to centralize telemetry.
- Shares dashboards with principal engineer performance and security teams.
- Prevents duplication by consolidating cost/performance analytics.

## Learning Objectives

- Instrument platform services with unified telemetry and cost analytics.
- Define SLOs, burn rates, and alerting strategies for platform teams.
- Automate reporting for leadership and stakeholder alignment.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| observability | Advanced | Unified observability dashboard | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| finops | Advanced | Cost analytics & optimization plan | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline
