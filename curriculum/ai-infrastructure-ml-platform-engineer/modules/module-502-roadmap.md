# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 502 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-502-api-platforms).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-502
- **Module Title**: API & Model Serving Platforms
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 42 hours (12 lecture, 18 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-501, MOD-207
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-505, PROJ-501

## Cross-Role Progression

- Connects reliability best practices from senior engineer modules with platform abstractions.
- Shares serving gateway patterns with architecture and security tracks to reduce duplicate designs.
- Feeds workflow orchestration and developer experience modules with standardized APIs.

## Learning Objectives

- Design serving gateways, routing, and lifecycle management for inference workloads.
- Implement rollout strategies, versioning, and observability for APIs.
- Enable extensibility for new model types (batch, streaming, generative).

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| api-platforms | Advanced | Serving architecture & rollout playbook | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| service-reliability | Advanced | SLO/observability dashboard | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Serving Patterns** – online, batch, streaming, hybrid.
2. **Routing & Discovery** – service mesh, gateways, DNS.
3. **Lifecycle & Rollouts** – canary, blue/green, rollback.
4. **Observability** – tracing, metrics, log correlation.
5. **Extensibility** – plugin architecture, abstractions.

## Hands-On Activities

- Gateway design workshop with reliability engineers.
- Rollout automation lab configuring canary pipelines.
- Observability dashboard build for serving endpoints.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Serving architecture dossier with rollout strategy.
- SLO dashboard and alert configuration evidence.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Rollout patterns reused by workflow orchestration and security modules.
- Observability assets integrated with principal engineer performance dashboards.
