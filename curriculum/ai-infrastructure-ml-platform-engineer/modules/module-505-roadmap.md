# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 505 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-505-workflow-orchestration).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-505
- **Module Title**: Workflow Orchestration & Pipelines
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 44 hours (12 lecture, 18 lab, 10 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-502, MOD-504
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-506, MOD-507, PROJ-503

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with MLOps, security, and compliance teams to centralize pipeline automation.
- Feeds principal engineer programs with reusable DAG patterns.
- Avoids duplication by leveraging shared orchestration tooling across squads.

## Learning Objectives

- Build resilient ML pipelines with retries, notifications, and compliance gates.
- Automate approvals, rollbacks, and promotion workflows.
- Integrate observability and cost tracking into pipeline operations.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| workflow-orchestration | Advanced | Pipeline/DAG design & automation toolkit | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| automation | Advanced | Promotion & rollback automation scripts | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Pipeline Patterns** – training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring.
2. **Reliability** – retries, checkpointing, workflow recovery.
3. **Compliance Gates** – approvals, policy enforcement, audits.
4. **Observability** – pipeline metrics, tracing, alerts.
5. **Developer UX** – templating, metadata, reuse.

## Hands-On Activities

- Pipeline implementation lab with orchestration tooling.
- Policy gate integration workshop using OPA/CI.
- Observability configuration exercise building dashboards.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Workflow automation package with documentation.
- Observability dashboard and runbook evidence.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Automation packages reused by security and compliance teams.
- Observability artifacts referenced by incident response modules.
