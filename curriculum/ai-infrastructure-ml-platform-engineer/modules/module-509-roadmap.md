# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 509 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-509-security).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-509
- **Module Title**: Platform Security & Compliance Foundations
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-505
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-510, PROJ-504

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with security engineer modules to reuse guardrail frameworks.
- Shares audit evidence and policy docs with compliance automation teams.
- Minimizes duplicate security implementations across platform squads.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate secrets, RBAC, and data protection controls across platform services.
- Embed policy enforcement and audit logging within workflows.
- Coordinate with security teams for incident response readiness.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| platform-security | Advanced | Security control implementation plan | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |
| compliance | Advanced | Audit evidence catalog | AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Security Baselines** – IAM, secrets, network policies.
2. **Guardrails** – policy enforcement, automation.
3. **Monitoring** – security telemetry, alerts, reporting.
4. **Incident Ready** – runbooks, exercises, escalation.
5. **Compliance Evidence** – logging, retention, attestations.

## Hands-On Activities

- Security guardrail integration lab with automation tooling.
- Incident response tabletop coordinated with security engineers.
- Audit evidence collection exercise.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Security control implementation report.
- Audit evidence package for platform services.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping
