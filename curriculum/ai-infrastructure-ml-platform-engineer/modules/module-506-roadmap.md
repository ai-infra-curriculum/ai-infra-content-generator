# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer | Module 506 deepens platform engineering capabilities (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-ml-platform-engineer/module-506-model-registry).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-506
- **Module Title**: Model Registry & Lifecycle Management
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer
- **Duration**: 40 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-504, MOD-505
- **Next Module(s)**: PROJ-504, PROJ-506

## Cross-Role Progression

- Synchronizes with security and compliance modules for promotion approvals.
- Shares registry patterns with principal engineer and architect governance frameworks.
- Minimizes duplicate tooling by centralizing lifecycle APIs.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement model registry with lineage, approvals, and promotion policies.
- Automate deployment promotion, rollback, and audit trails.
- Integrate registry metadata with monitoring and analytics.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
