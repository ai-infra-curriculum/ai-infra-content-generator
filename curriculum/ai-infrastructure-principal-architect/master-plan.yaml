risk_register:
- risk: Executive availability delays board simulations and validation workshops.
  impact: high
  likelihood: medium
  mitigation: Secure executive sponsors early, provide asynchronous briefing packets, record sessions.
- risk: Access to sensitive financial or M&A data is restricted.
  impact: medium
  likelihood: medium
  mitigation: Use anonymized cases, partner with finance/legal for redacted datasets, add data-handling guidelines.
