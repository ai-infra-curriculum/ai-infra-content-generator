# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 910 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-910-supply-chain-security).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-910
- **Module Title**: Supply Chain Security for AI Systems
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 44 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 10 project, 6 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-909, MOD-205
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-911, MOD-912, PROJ-904

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with DevSecOps and platform release engineering teams.
- Shares SBOM/provenance infrastructure with compliance and platform reliability.
- Avoids duplication by integrating into existing release pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

- Secure model, data, and software supply chains with provenance and attestation.
- Integrate SBOM generation, signing, and verification into pipelines.
- Operationalize response processes for supply chain compromises.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| supply-chain-security | Advanced | Supply chain security architecture | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| software-integrity | Advanced | SBOM & attestation workflow | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Supply Chain Threats** – dependency, data, model, tooling risk.
2. **SBOM & Provenance** – generation, storage, verification.
3. **Attestation** – signatures, verification processes, policy enforcement.
4. **Monitoring** – anomaly detection, threat intel integration.
5. **Response** – compromise playbooks, rollback strategies.

## Hands-On Activities

- SBOM and attestation pipeline lab.
- Threat modeling workshop for supply chain scenarios.
- Response simulation for compromised model artifact.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Supply chain security plan with integration milestones.
- Incident response playbook for supply chain breaches.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- SBOM infrastructure reused by compliance and platform release teams.
- Response playbooks integrated with security operations module.
