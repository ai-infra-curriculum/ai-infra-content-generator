# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 908 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-908-runtime-security).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-908
- **Module Title**: Runtime Security & Monitoring for AI Workloads
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 44 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 10 project, 2 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-904, MOD-905
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-911, PROJ-903, PROJ-905

## Cross-Role Progression

- Integrates with reliability and performance monitoring systems to minimize duplicate instrumentation.
- Feeds SOC workflows with AI-specific telemetry.
- Shares runtime policies with compliance and incident management modules.

## Learning Objectives

- Deploy runtime security agents/EDA to protect training and inference workloads.
- Correlate runtime signals with SIEM/SOC tooling.
- Automate response workflows for runtime anomalies.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| runtime-security | Advanced | Runtime monitoring & response design | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| observability | Advanced | Telemetry integration blueprint | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Runtime Threats** – resource abuse, model tampering, data exfiltration.
2. **Instrumentation** – agents, eBPF, container security, GPU monitoring.
3. **Telemetry** – log ingestion, metrics, alerts, correlation.
4. **Response Automation** – SOAR integration, playbooks, runbooks.
5. **Testing** – chaos experiments, detection tuning, validation.

## Hands-On Activities

- Runtime instrumentation lab deploying security agents.
- Telemetry correlation exercise building SOC dashboards.
- Automation workshop with response playbooks.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Runtime security architecture & operations plan.
- Detection tuning report with coverage metrics.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Runtime telemetry shared with SOC and reliability teams.
- Automation scripts reused by security operations project.
