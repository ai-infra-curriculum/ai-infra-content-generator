# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 906 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-906-adversarial-ml).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-906
- **Module Title**: Adversarial ML Defense Engineering
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 48 hours (16 lecture, 20 lab, 10 project, 2 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-901, MOD-903
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-912, PROJ-903

## Cross-Role Progression

- Collaborates with ML research, MLOps, and principal engineer red team programs.
- Shares adversarial datasets and frameworks to avoid redundant tooling.
- Feeds executive risk reporting with adversarial resilience metrics.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop adversarial testing pipelines and evaluation metrics.
- Implement robust training techniques and inference defenses.
- Operationalize response playbooks for adversarial events.
