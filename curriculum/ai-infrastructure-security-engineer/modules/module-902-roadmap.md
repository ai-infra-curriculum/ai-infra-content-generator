# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 902 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-902-zero-trust-architecture).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-902
- **Module Title**: Zero-Trust Architecture for AI Platforms
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 44 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-901, MOD-208
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-905, PROJ-901

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with platform networking and identity teams to enforce zero-trust patterns.
- Shares segmentation designs with principal architect governance frameworks.
- Reuses identity guardrails to prevent duplication across platform services.

## Learning Objectives

- Design identity-centric segmentation for AI training and serving workloads.
- Integrate workload identity, policy engines, and access governance.
- Automate verification, observability, and compliance reporting for zero-trust posture.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| zero-trust | Advanced | Zero-trust architecture dossier | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| identity-access-management | Advanced | Workload identity design & policy set | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Zero-Trust Principles** – assume breach, continuous verification.
2. **Identity Fabric** – workforce vs workload identity, federation.
3. **Segmentation** – micro/macro segmentation, service meshes.
4. **Policy Enforcement** – PDP/PEP patterns, authorization workflows.
5. **Monitoring** – posture dashboards, drift detection, attestations.

## Hands-On Activities

- Zero-trust blueprint lab mapping controls to architecture.
- Policy authoring workshop with Rego/Kyverno/OPA examples.
- Segmentation design review with platform networking stakeholders.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Zero-trust design package with approval from platform architects.
- Automation implementation plan with metrics and dependencies.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Segmentation patterns reused by site reliability and networking teams.
- Policy enforcement components shared with compliance automation efforts.
