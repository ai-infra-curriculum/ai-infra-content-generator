# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 903 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-903-cryptography-for-ml).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-903
- **Module Title**: Applied Cryptography for ML Systems
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 42 hours (14 lecture, 16 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-901, MOD-902
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-906, PROJ-902

## Cross-Role Progression

- Collaborates with data governance teams to reuse encryption/key management platforms.
- Supports compliance automation by providing evidence templates.
- Links to principal architect privacy roadmaps to avoid redundant policies.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement encryption, signing, and privacy-preserving techniques in ML pipelines.
- Design key management and HSM integrations for AI workloads.
- Evaluate advanced cryptographic approaches for collaborative ML scenarios.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| applied-cryptography | Advanced | Crypto architecture & key management plan | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| data-protection | Advanced | Privacy control matrix & evidence pack | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Crypto Basics** – symmetric/asymmetric, key management, HSM.
2. **Data Protection** – encryption in-use/at-rest/in-transit, tokenization.
3. **Privacy Enhancements** – differential privacy, homomorphic encryption.
4. **Secure Collaboration** – SMPC, federated learning security.
5. **Compliance Mapping** – evidence templates, audit automation.

## Hands-On Activities

- Key management integration lab using cloud KMS/HSM.
- Differential privacy exercise comparing utility vs risk.
- Evidence template workshop with compliance stakeholders.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Cryptography implementation plan with risk analysis.
- Privacy control documentation for audit readiness.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Key management patterns reused by data governance teams.
- Evidence templates feed compliance automation module outputs.
