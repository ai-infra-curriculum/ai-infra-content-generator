# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 911 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-911-security-operations).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-911
- **Module Title**: Security Operations & Incident Response for AI
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 46 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 8 project, 6 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-908, MOD-910
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-912, PROJ-905

## Cross-Role Progression

- Integrates with SOC teams to reuse tooling, runbooks, and detection engineering workflows.
- Collaborates with team lead and principal engineer incident programs to avoid duplicate drills.
- Supplies executive communications templates for principal architect governance.

## Learning Objectives

- Embed AI workloads into SOC workflows, SIEM, and SOAR tooling.
- Develop incident response runbooks tailored to AI infrastructure.
- Coordinate executive and customer communications for security events.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
