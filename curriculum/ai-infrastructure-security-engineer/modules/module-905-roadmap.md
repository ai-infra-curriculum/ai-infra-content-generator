# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 905 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-905-secrets-management).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-905
- **Module Title**: Secrets & Identity Management for ML
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 42 hours (12 lecture, 16 lab, 8 portfolio, 6 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-902, MOD-904
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-907, MOD-908, PROJ-901

## Cross-Role Progression

- Aligns with DevOps/Platform identity programs to avoid duplicate tooling.
- Shares workload identity patterns with principal engineer automation modules.
- Feeds compliance audits with credential lifecycle evidence.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement secret storage, rotation, and access policies for ML workloads.
- Design workload identity (SPIFFE/SPIRE, IAM roles) for pipelines.
- Automate policy enforcement and anomaly detection for credential usage.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| secrets-management | Advanced | Secrets architecture & rotation policy | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| identity-access-management | Advanced | Workload identity rollout plan | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Secret Lifecycle** – storage, rotation, revocation, auditing.
2. **Workload Identity** – SPIFFE/SPIRE, cloud IAM, service accounts.
3. **Access Policies** – least privilege, just-in-time, break-glass.
4. **Monitoring** – credential misuse detection, anomaly alerts.
5. **Automation** – GitOps integration, policy enforcement pipelines.

## Hands-On Activities

- Secrets rotation automation lab using Vault/KMS.
- Workload identity design workshop with platform teams.
- Credential monitoring exercise with simulated misuse events.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Secrets and identity rollout plan with change management timeline.
- Monitoring dashboard and alert configuration evidence.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Identity patterns reused by platform engineering and compliance teams.
- Monitoring signals integrated into security operations playbooks.
