# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 901 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-901-ml-security-foundations).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-901
- **Module Title**: ML Security Foundations
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 46 hours (16 lecture, 18 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-201, MOD-206, MOD-207
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-902, MOD-903, PROJ-901

## Cross-Role Progression

- Builds on AI infrastructure reliability and MLOps modules to introduce security-first thinking.
- Feeds threat models and baseline controls to principal engineer and architect security plans.
- Avoids duplication by referencing shared runbooks and platform hardening guides.

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze AI/ML threat models covering data, model, and pipeline layers.
- Prioritize controls and hardening strategies aligned to risk appetite.
- Establish security baselines and assessment templates for downstream modules.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| ml-security | Advanced | Threat model & control matrix | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| threat-modeling | Advanced | Security baseline assessment | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Threat Landscape** – supply-chain, data poisoning, model theft, insider.
2. **Baseline Controls** – hardening guides, secure configs, guardrails.
3. **Risk Assessment** – scoring methodologies, prioritization, reporting.
4. **Security Architecture** – shared responsibility, patterns, defenses.
5. **Readiness Metrics** – maturity models, scorecards, review cadence.

## Hands-On Activities

- Threat modeling workshop with cross-functional partners.
- Baseline hardening lab using reference infrastructure.
- Risk assessment exercise producing mitigation backlog.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Security baseline report with prioritized remediations.
- Threat model presentation and peer review.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Threat modeling templates shared with principal engineer defenses.
- Baseline controls reused by platform reliability and compliance teams.
