# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 904 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-904-network-security).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-904
- **Module Title**: Network Security & Segmentation for AI
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 44 hours (14 lecture, 18 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-201, MOD-901
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-905, MOD-908, PROJ-901

## Cross-Role Progression

- Shares network segmentation and telemetry with reliability and performance teams.
- Avoids duplication by reusing service mesh and gateway configurations.
- Feeds runtime security module with network observability artifacts.

## Learning Objectives

- Architect network security for training clusters, feature stores, and inference endpoints.
- Deploy traffic inspection, anomaly detection, and egress controls.
- Integrate network telemetry into SOC dashboards and automation.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| network-security | Advanced | Network segmentation & monitoring plan | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| observability | Advanced | Telemetry integration blueprint | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **AI Network Topologies** – control, data, management planes.
2. **Segmentation Strategies** – meshes, gateways, routing policies.
3. **Traffic Inspection** – TLS termination, DPI, ML-specific patterns.
4. **Monitoring & Detection** – flow logs, anomaly detection, alerting.
5. **Automation** – IaC, GitOps, continuous validation.

## Hands-On Activities

- Network policy lab using service mesh or CNI tooling.
- Telemetry integration workshop building dashboards.
- Detection tuning exercise with simulated attack traffic.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Network security design pack with approval from platform networks.
- Detection tuning report summarizing improvements.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Network policies shared with platform operations teams.
- Telemetry dashboards reused by runtime security and SOC teams.
