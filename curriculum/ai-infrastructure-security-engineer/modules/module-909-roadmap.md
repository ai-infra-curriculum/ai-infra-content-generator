# Module Roadmap

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Module 909 operationalizes security engineering excellence (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/module-909-policy-as-code).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-909
- **Module Title**: Policy-as-Code & Guardrails
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Duration**: 42 hours (12 lecture, 18 lab, 8 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-907, MOD-908
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-910, PROJ-902, PROJ-904

## Cross-Role Progression

- Collaborates with platform automation teams to centralize guardrail repositories.
- Shares policy libraries with compliance and principal architect frameworks.
- Avoids duplication by reusing core policy engines and pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

- Build policy-as-code libraries for infrastructure, pipelines, and runtime.
- Automate enforcement in CI/CD, deployment, and runtime environments.
- Establish governance dashboards and exception workflows.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| policy-as-code | Advanced | Policy library & enforcement pipeline | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| automation | Advanced | Exception workflow & reporting | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Content Outline
