# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Built on legacy assets in `projects/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/project-903-adversarial-defense`.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-903
- **Project Title**: Adversarial Defense Program
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Capstone for MOD-906 and MOD-908
- **Estimated Duration**: 110 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-906, MOD-908
- **Related Assessments**: Adversarial defense review, incident simulation debrief

## Learning Objectives

- Develop adversarial testing harnesses and integrate results with monitoring.
- Deploy defenses (robust training, detection, sanitization) across ML workloads.
- Coordinate response playbooks and executive communications for adversarial events.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| adversarial-ml | Advanced | Testing harness & robustness metrics | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| ml-threat-defense | Advanced | Defense implementation plan | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| observability | Advanced | Detection dashboard & alert tuning | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Key Deliverables

- Automated adversarial testing suite with reporting.
- Defense implementation backlog with prioritized actions.
- Incident response playbook and communication templates.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Red-team simulation workshop with research & platform teams.
- Defense tuning lab measuring accuracy vs robustness trade-offs.
- Incident tabletop exercise focusing on adversarial event.

### Milestone Schedule

- Week 1-2: Harness design & baseline evaluation.
- Week 3-4: Defense implementation and testing.
- Week 5-6: Monitoring integration and tuning.
- Week 7-8: Response simulation and executive readout.

## Assessment & Validation

- Security architecture/design review with platform and compliance stakeholders.
- Peer review with principal engineer/architect counterparts to ensure cross-role alignment.
- Documentation audit capturing metrics, evidence, and response readiness.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/project-903-adversarial-defense`
- Coordinates with principal engineer, architect, and compliance tracks to minimize duplicated security deliverables.
- Update repository mapping after validation to publish solutions in `solutions/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/projects/project-903-adversarial-defense`.
