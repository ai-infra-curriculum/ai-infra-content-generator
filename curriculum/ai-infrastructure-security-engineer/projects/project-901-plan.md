# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Built on legacy assets in `projects/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/project-901-zero-trust-platform`.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-901
- **Project Title**: Zero-Trust Platform Implementation
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Follows MOD-902, MOD-904, MOD-905 outputs
- **Estimated Duration**: 120 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-902, MOD-904, MOD-905
- **Related Assessments**: Architecture review, security posture audit

## Learning Objectives

- Design zero-trust architecture spanning identity, segmentation, and policy enforcement.
- Implement automated verification and observability for zero-trust posture.
- Deliver executive-ready documentation detailing risk reduction and roadmap.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| zero-trust | Advanced | Architecture dossier & enforcement plan | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| network-security | Advanced | Segmentation blueprint & monitoring dashboard | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| identity-access-management | Advanced | Workload identity rollout & policy set | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Key Deliverables

- Zero-trust reference architecture and policy enforcement guide.
- Operational monitoring dashboard with key posture metrics.
- Executive briefing summarizing outcomes, risks, and next steps.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Architecture design sessions with platform and networking teams.
- Policy enforcement lab integrating with GitOps/CI pipelines.
- Posture audit workshop validating controls and metrics.

### Milestone Schedule

- Week 1-2: Threat modeling, stakeholder alignment, architecture draft.
- Week 3-4: Policy automation and segmentation implementation.
- Week 5-6: Monitoring integration and validation tests.
- Week 7-8: Executive review and handover playbooks.

## Assessment & Validation

- Security architecture/design review with platform and compliance stakeholders.
- Peer review with principal engineer/architect counterparts to ensure cross-role alignment.
- Documentation audit capturing metrics, evidence, and response readiness.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/project-901-zero-trust-platform`
- Coordinates with principal engineer, architect, and compliance tracks to minimize duplicated security deliverables.
- Update repository mapping after validation to publish solutions in `solutions/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/projects/project-901-zero-trust-platform`.
