# Project Plan

> AI Infrastructure Security Engineer | Built on legacy assets in `projects/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/project-904-secure-cicd`.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-904
- **Project Title**: Secure ML CI/CD Pipeline
- **Target Role(s)**: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: Derived from MOD-909 and MOD-910
- **Estimated Duration**: 100 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: MOD-909, MOD-910
- **Related Assessments**: Supply-chain security review, pipeline demo

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate supply-chain security, attestations, and policy enforcement into ML CI/CD.
- Automate SBOM generation, signing, and verification across build stages.
- Establish monitoring and response workflows for supply-chain risks.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| supply-chain-security | Advanced | SBOM & attestation pipeline | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| automation | Advanced | Guardrail integration & alerting | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |
| runtime-security | Advanced | Release monitoring plan | AI Infrastructure Security Engineer |

## Key Deliverables

- Secure CI/CD pipeline design and implementation guide.
- SBOM archive with attestation evidence and reporting dashboards.
- Incident playbook for supply-chain compromises.

## Learning Activities & Milestones

### Guided Activities

- Pipeline hardening lab with attestation tooling.
- SBOM generation workshop integrating with artifact registry.
- Response drill targeting compromised dependency scenario.

### Milestone Schedule

- Week 1-2: Pipeline assessment & design.
- Week 3-4: Tooling integration & validation.
- Week 5-6: Monitoring & alerting configuration.
- Week 7-8: Executive review and production rollout plan.

## Assessment & Validation

- Security architecture/design review with platform and compliance stakeholders.
- Peer review with principal engineer/architect counterparts to ensure cross-role alignment.
- Documentation audit capturing metrics, evidence, and response readiness.

## Legacy Alignment & Next Steps

- Legacy source: `projects/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/project-904-secure-cicd`
- Coordinates with principal engineer, architect, and compliance tracks to minimize duplicated security deliverables.
- Update repository mapping after validation to publish solutions in `solutions/ai-infrastructure-security-engineer/projects/project-904-secure-cicd`.
