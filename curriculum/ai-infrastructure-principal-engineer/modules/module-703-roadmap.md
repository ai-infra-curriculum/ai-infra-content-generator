# Module Roadmap

> Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer | Module 703 extends principal IC scope (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-principal-engineer/module-703-performance-at-scale).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-703
- **Module Title**: Performance Engineering at Extreme Scale
- **Target Role(s)**: Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer
- **Duration**: 56 hours (16 lecture, 24 lab, 12 project, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-107, MOD-202, MOD-205
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-706, PROJ-702

## Cross-Role Progression

- Extends senior performance labs to principal scope across GPU, storage, and networking.
- Introduces board-level cost/performance storytelling shared with architects.
- Coordinates with Performance Engineer track to reuse tooling and benchmarks.

## Learning Objectives

- Build advanced benchmarking, profiling, and regression automation for AI workloads.
- Optimize hardware utilization, scheduling, and orchestration for extreme scale.
- Communicate performance outcomes, investments, and trade-offs to executives.
