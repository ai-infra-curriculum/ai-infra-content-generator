# Module Roadmap

> Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer | Module 702 extends principal IC scope (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-principal-engineer/module-702-complex-systems-design).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-702
- **Module Title**: Complex Systems Design Leadership
- **Target Role(s)**: Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer
- **Duration**: 50 hours (16 lecture, 20 lab, 10 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-701, MOD-305, MOD-401
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-703, MOD-706, PROJ-702

## Cross-Role Progression

- Builds on technical excellence foundations with end-to-end systems design accountability.
- Introduces principal-level trade-off analysis, RFC processes, and multi-team alignment.
- Links with Principal Architect governance artifacts for enterprise coherence.

## Learning Objectives

- Lead systems design reviews spanning compute, data, networking, and operations.
- Quantify trade-offs across cost, resilience, performance, and time-to-market.
- Facilitate cross-team alignment and decision-making frameworks.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| complex-systems-design | Expert | System RFC + decision log | Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer |
| architecture-governance | Expert | Design review charter & metrics | Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer |

## Content Outline

1. **Systems Thinking** – domain decomposition, risk analysis, future-proofing.
2. **Design Frameworks** – RFC lifecycle, decision logs, consensus models.
3. **Trade-off Analysis** – cost, resilience, performance, sustainability.
4. **Execution Alignment** – workstreams, sequencing, dependency management.
5. **Design Validation** – simulations, prototyping, executive briefings.

## Hands-On Activities

- Complex architecture design workshop with cross-functional stakeholders.
- Trade-off analysis lab using scenario modeling tools.
- Design review facilitation simulation with executive panel.

## Assessments & Evidence

- Systems design dossier and decision log for review board.
- Executive summary presenting design trade-offs and recommendations.

## Shared Assets & Legacy Mapping

- Shares RFC formats with architect and platform teams.
- Feeds decision artifacts into governance repositories to avoid duplication.
