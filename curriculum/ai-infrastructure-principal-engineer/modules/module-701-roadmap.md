# Module Roadmap

> Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer | Module 701 extends principal IC scope (legacy alignment: modules/ai-infrastructure-principal-engineer/module-701-technical-excellence).

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-701
- **Module Title**: Technical Excellence at Principal Scale
- **Target Role(s)**: Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer
- **Duration**: 52 hours (18 lecture, 22 lab, 8 portfolio, 4 assessment)
- **Prerequisites**: MOD-205, MOD-206, MOD-208, MOD-309
- **Next Module(s)**: MOD-702, MOD-705, PROJ-701

## Cross-Role Progression

- Builds on senior engineering quality frameworks and architecture communication skills.
- Introduces principal-level design reviews, code quality programs, and automation guardrails.
- Shares technical excellence artifacts with Principal Architect and specialized tracks to reduce duplication.

## Learning Objectives

- Define principal-level quality bars, review cadences, and automation coverage expectations.
- Codify architecture guardrails, style guides, and refactoring strategies for large codebases.
- Establish metrics and dashboards for technical health across multiple services.

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
