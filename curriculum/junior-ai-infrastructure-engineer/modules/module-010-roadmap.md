# Module Roadmap

> Create `metadata.yaml` alongside this file using `./tools/curriculum.py scaffold-metadata ...` or copy `templates/curriculum/module-metadata-template.yaml`.

## Module Overview

- **Module ID**: MOD-010
- **Module Title**: Cloud Platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Target Role(s)**: Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer
- **Duration**: 20 hours
- **Prerequisites**: Docker, basic networking
- **Next Module(s)**: TBD in master plan

## Cross-Role Progression

- **Builds On** (modules/roles): Modules before 010
- **Adds New Depth For** (roles): Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer
- **Shared Assets** (reuse / adapt): See `modules/junior-ai-infrastructure-engineer/module-010-cloud-platforms-(aws/gcp/azure)`
- **Differentiators** (role-specific emphasis): Entry-level focus on Cloud Platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## Learning Objectives

- Deploy applications to cloud platforms
- Choose appropriate cloud services
- Implement cloud security best practices
- Manage cloud costs

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
