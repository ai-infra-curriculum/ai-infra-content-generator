# Project Plan

> Create or update project `metadata.yaml` using `./tools/curriculum.py scaffold-metadata ... --type project` or copy `templates/curriculum/project-metadata-template.yaml`.

## Project Overview

- **Project ID**: PROJ-05
- **Project Title**: Production-Ready ML System (Capstone)
- **Target Role(s)**: Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer
- **Placement in Curriculum**: See master plan sequencing
- **Estimated Duration**: 120 hours
- **Prerequisite Modules / Skills**: All previous projects and modules
- **Related Assessments**: Refer to module quizzes

## Learning Objectives

- Apply concepts from prerequisite modules to a real-world scenario
- Produce a portfolio artifact demonstrating production-ready ml system (capstone)

## Competency Alignment

| Competency | Proficiency Target | Evidence / Assessment | Role Alignment |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Refer to skills matrix | Working | Project deliverables | Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer |

## Project Narrative

### Problem Statement
- Refer to legacy project README (`projects/junior-ai-infrastructure-engineer/project-05-*/README.md`)

### Deliverables
- Source code and deployment assets
- Documentation/runbook
- Demo or validation report

### Constraints & Assumptions
- Use tech stack defined in legacy project
- Follow security and compliance guidance from curriculum

## Learner Experience

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time | Instructor Touchpoints |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Kickoff | Review legacy project brief | 2h | Mentor sync |
| Build | Implement features/infrastructure | 120 hours | Weekly check-ins |
| Review | Present and get feedback | 4h | Demo + review |

## Assets & Reuse Strategy

- **Starter Assets**: Legacy repo project resources
- **Shared Components**: Align with solutions repo when created
- **Role Progression**: Forms baseline for mid-level projects
- **Differentiators**: Entry-level scope and guardrails

## Solution & Repository Plan

- **Solutions Placement**: To be defined in repository strategy
- **Solution Path / Repo**: `solutions/junior-ai-infrastructure-engineer/project-05` (planned)
- **Validation Requirements**: Follow project rubric and CI pipeline
- **Access Controls**: Instructor review before sharing publicly

## Assessment & Rubric

- Evaluation aligns with rubric in legacy repo
- Automatic checks: run provided tests/linting
- Manual review: architecture/code quality walkthrough

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Learners blocked on environment setup → Provide starter scripts
- **Risk**: Scope creep → Adhere to acceptance criteria

## References & Inspiration

- Legacy project README, implementation guide, and resources

## Sign-off

- **Author**: Migration script placeholder
- **Reviewer(s)**: To be assigned
- **Date Approved**: Pending
