## Getting Started

### First Time Here?

1. **Read the Documentation**:
   - Start with [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md)
   - Review [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
   - Check [Best Practices](docs/best-practices.md)

2. **Explore Examples**:
   - Look at templates in `templates/`
   - Review workflows in `workflows/`
   - Check validation tools in `validation/`

3. **Generate Your First Module**:
   - Follow [Module Generation Workflow](workflows/module-generation.md)
   - Use templates from `templates/lecture-notes/`
   - Run validation: `python validation/completeness/check-module-completeness.py`

### Common Getting Started Questions

**Q: What AI model should I use?**
A: The framework is system-agnostic. Works with Claude, GPT-4, or any LLM. See [Tools and Automation](docs/tools-and-automation.md) for recommendations.

**Q: How long does it take to generate a module?**
A: 8-12 hours for a complete 12,000+ word module with examples, case studies, and exercises.

**Q: Can I use this for non-technical content?**
A: Yes! While designed for technical curriculum, the framework adapts to any educational content.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Validation Scripts Not Working

**Symptoms**: `python validation/code-validators/validate-code-examples.py` fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Ensure Python 3.9+
python --version

# Install optional dependencies
pip install markdown

# Check file path is correct
ls validation/code-validators/validate-code-examples.py

# Run with full path
python /full/path/to/validate-code-examples.py yourfile.md
```

#### Issue 2: Module Generation Takes Too Long

**Symptoms**: Generating content takes 20+ hours

**Solutions**:
- Break into smaller chunks (one section at a time)
- Use more specific prompts
- Leverage MCP servers for acceleration (see docs/tools-and-automation.md)
- Consider using Claude Code skills

#### Issue 3: Generated Code Has Errors

**Symptoms**: Code examples don't run or have syntax errors

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Always validate generated code
python validation/code-validators/validate-code-examples.py lecture-notes.md

# Test code manually
python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('example.py').read())"

# Use linters
pylint your_code.py
```

#### Issue 4: Word Count Too Low

**Symptoms**: Module has < 12,000 words

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check current count
wc -w lecture-notes.md

# Use completeness checker
python validation/completeness/check-module-completeness.py lecture-notes.md

# Expand thin sections (see prompts/lecture-generation/)
# Add more code examples
# Expand case studies with metrics
# Add troubleshooting section
```

#### Issue 5: Templates Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Can't find templates

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify you're in the correct directory
pwd

# Check if templates exist
ls templates/

# Use full paths if needed
cp /full/path/to/templates/lecture-notes/module-template.md ./
```

2. **Review templates** for structure examples
3. **Search issues** for similar problems
4. **Ask in Discussions** for community help
5. **Open an issue** if you found a bug
