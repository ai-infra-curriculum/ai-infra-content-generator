# ADR-001: Multi-Cloud Strategy and Provider Selection

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Decision Makers**: Cloud Architect, CTO, VP Engineering
**Impact**: Critical - Foundational decision affecting all other architecture choices

---

## Context

The organization needs to expand AI infrastructure to support global operations while addressing:

1. **Vendor Lock-in Risk**: Current 100% AWS dependency limits negotiation power and creates business risk
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and 13 other data residency requirements across 15 countries
3. **Cost Optimization**: Single-cloud pricing limits ability to optimize costs
4. **Service Innovation**: Different clouds excel at different AI/ML capabilities

**Current State**:
- 100% AWS ($38M/year spend)
- Unable to meet EU data residency requirements
- Limited bargaining power in enterprise agreement negotiations
- Missing GCP's AI/ML innovations (TPUs, Vertex AI)

**Constraints**:
- Must achieve 99.95% availability
- RTO <1 hour, RPO <15 minutes
- Existing team primarily AWS-skilled
- Limited budget for migration ($5M one-time)

---

## Decision

Adopt a **Best-of-Breed Multi-Cloud Strategy** spanning three cloud providers:

### Selected Providers

| Provider | Primary Use Cases | Target Allocation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **AWS** (Primary) | Production APIs, storage, mature workloads | 48% ($12M/year) |
| **GCP** (AI/ML) | Model training, LLM inference, analytics | 32% ($8M/year) |
| **Azure** (Enterprise) | Microsoft integration, hybrid cloud | 20% ($5M/year) |

### Distribution Rationale

**AWS - Breadth and Scale**
- Retain for production APIs (proven, mature)
- Leverage S3 for primary object storage
- Use EKS for general compute workloads
- **Why**: Largest ecosystem, most services, proven at scale

**GCP - AI/ML Excellence**
- Primary platform for model training
- LLM inference using TPUs (50% cheaper than GPUs)
- BigQuery for data analytics
- **Why**: Best AI/ML services, TPU hardware advantage, native TensorFlow/PyTorch optimization

**Azure - Enterprise Integration**
- Microsoft stack integration (AD, Office 365)
- Hybrid cloud for on-premises connectivity
- Enterprise customer requirements
- **Why**: Required for Microsoft-dependent enterprise customers, strong compliance certifications

### Multi-Cloud Operating Model

1. **Cloud-Agnostic Core**: Use Kubernetes, Terraform, and open-source tools
2. **Managed Services Where Beneficial**: Use cloud-native services (Vertex AI, Aurora) when clear advantage
3. **Workload Placement Policy**: Place workloads based on decision matrix (data residency > cost > performance)
4. **Unified Operations**: Single observability stack (Datadog), secrets management (Vault), CI/CD (GitLab)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Stay 100% AWS (Multi-Region)

**Pros**:
- No additional complexity
- Team already skilled
- Simplified operations

**Cons**:
- Doesn't solve data sovereignty (AWS doesn't have presence in all required countries)
- No cost leverage
- Vendor lock-in persists
- Missing GCP AI/ML innovations

**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - Fails to meet regulatory and cost objectives

### Alternative 2: Full Multi-Cloud (4+ providers including Alibaba, Oracle)

**Pros**:
- Maximum flexibility
- Presence in China (Alibaba)

**Cons**:
- Excessive operational complexity
- Diminishing returns beyond 3 clouds
- Team skill gaps

**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - Complexity outweighs benefits

### Alternative 3: Hybrid Cloud (AWS + On-Premises)

**Pros**:
- Leverage existing data center
- Lower egress costs

**Cons**:
- Data center at capacity
- Higher operational burden
- Doesn't solve data sovereignty

**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - Doesn't address core requirements

### Alternative 4: Gradual Multi-Cloud (Start with AWS + GCP)

**Pros**:
- Lower initial risk
- Team can adapt gradually

**Cons**:
- Doesn't solve Azure integration requirements immediately
- Two-phase migration cost

**Decision**: ⚠️ Partially Accepted - Will pilot with GCP first, then Azure (see Migration Strategy)

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Cost Savings**: $8M/year (35% reduction) through:
  - Competitive cloud pricing leverage
  - Workload optimization (place each workload on cheapest suitable cloud)
  - Reserved instance portfolio optimization

✅ **Regulatory Compliance**: Can meet data residency in all 15 countries:
  - GCP has data centers in required EU locations
  - Azure covers additional enterprise requirements
  - AWS provides global scale

✅ **Risk Mitigation**:
  - No single cloud dependency
  - Active-active architecture eliminates idle DR resources
  - Cloud outages don't take down entire platform (99.95% availability achieved)

✅ **Innovation Access**:
  - GCP TPUs for LLM training (50% cost reduction)
  - AWS maturity for production APIs
  - Azure for enterprise integration

### Negative

⚠️ **Increased Complexity**:
  - 3 cloud consoles to manage
  - Different APIs and tools
  - More potential points of failure
  - **Mitigation**: Use cloud-agnostic tools (Kubernetes, Terraform), unified observability (Datadog)

⚠️ **Team Upskilling**:
  - Need GCP and Azure expertise
  - Training costs (~$200K)
  - Potential turnover risk
  - **Mitigation**: Hire 2 multi-cloud specialists, train existing team, focus on cloud-agnostic tools

⚠️ **Data Egress Costs**:
  - Cross-cloud data transfer expensive ($0.08-$0.12/GB)
  - Inter-cloud network costs ($15K/month for Direct Connect/Interconnect)
  - **Mitigation**: Minimize cross-cloud data movement, use Direct Connect, regional data lakes

⚠️ **Migration Risk**:
  - 12-month migration timeline
  - Potential service disruptions
  - **Mitigation**: Phased approach, pilot first, thorough testing

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-3)
- Set up GCP and Azure accounts
- Establish Direct Connect/Interconnect
- Deploy Vault, Datadog, ArgoCD
- Training for team

### Phase 2: Pilot (Month 4-6)
- Deploy non-critical workload to GCP
- Test cross-cloud connectivity
- Validate monitoring and DR
- Refine runbooks

### Phase 3: Data Layer (Month 7-9)
- Set up regional data lakes (GCS, Azure Blob)
- Implement cross-cloud replication
- Migrate training data
- Validate data sovereignty

### Phase 4: Production (Month 10-12)
- Migrate production workloads
- Achieve target distribution (48% AWS, 32% GCP, 20% Azure)
- Full DR testing
- Decommission single-cloud resources
