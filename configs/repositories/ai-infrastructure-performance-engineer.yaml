notes: |
  Legacy lessons include both `mod-00x-*` folders and older numbered directories. Prefer the `mod-00x-*` content and
  archive older duplicates (e.g., `01-gpu-fundamentals`). Projects 01–03 map to PROJ-521…523; use `project-03-llm-inference`
  for PROJ-524 and treat `project-01-model-compression`/`project-02-gpu-optimization` as historical references unless
  additional exercises are required.
