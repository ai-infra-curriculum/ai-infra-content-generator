## Hiring Signals & Requirements

- Most postings require **deep hands-on expertise**: ability to debug in production, write high-impact code, and lead architecture simultaneously.  
- Emphasis on **influence without authority**—candidates must lead via reviews, mentorship, and technical strategy rather than management.  
- Strong expectation of **executive communication**: presenting to CTO/VP level, explaining risk/cost/performance trade-offs.  
- Many postings reference **security & compliance** exposure, especially in finance and healthcare.  
- **Open-source contributions** and **public speaking** (meetups, conferences) often cited as differentiators.
