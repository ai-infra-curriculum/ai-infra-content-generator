# Role Research Brief: Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer

**Experience Level:** 13+ years building large-scale infrastructure with 5+ years operating as a senior or staff engineer driving cross-organization initiatives. Candidates are typically sourced from hyperscalers, high-growth AI platform teams, or infrastructure skunkworks with deep systems expertise.  
**Market Demand:** Scarce principal IC talent across cloud providers, foundational model companies, and regulated enterprises expanding AI investment. Roles emphasize hands-on technical depth combined with broad architectural influence.  
**Salary Range (US 2025):**
- Min: $240,000
- Median: $330,000
- Max: $600,000+ (total comp; equity-heavy offers common at hyperscalers/startups)

## Core Responsibilities
- Lead architecture and delivery of complex AI/ML infrastructure programs spanning compute, data, serving, and tooling.
- Drive performance, reliability, and cost optimization across global fleets (GPU/accelerator clusters, storage fabrics, high-throughput networking).
- Author and socialize long-term technical roadmaps, engineering standards, and technical strategy for multiple product areas.
- Conduct design reviews, postmortems, and technical audits for mission-critical systems; unblock teams at depth when incidents arise.
- Mentor senior/staff engineers, champion engineering excellence, and lead communities of practice across organizations.
- Partner with product, research, and platform teams to incubate applied research projects and translate innovation into production.
- Coordinate cross-organization execution, stakeholder alignment, and communication for multi-quarter initiatives.
- Represent engineering in executive forums, defending technical investments, risk posture, and performance outcomes.

## Technical & Strategic Skills
### Required
- Expert mastery of distributed systems, large-scale storage, networking, and GPU/accelerator infrastructure for AI workloads.
- Deep performance engineering experience: benchmarking, profiling, compiler/toolchain optimization, capacity planning.
- Advanced architectural reasoning: decomposition, trade-off analysis, design documentation, heavily regulated environments.
- Infrastructure automation expertise (Kubernetes, service mesh, Terraform, GitOps) at very large scale.
- Observability and reliability leadership: SLO/SLA design, chaos testing, incident response, postmortem practices.
- Strong data infrastructure knowledge (streaming, batch, feature stores) and ML platform integration.
- Executive-ready communication; ability to articulate technical risk/value to VPs, CTO, or board observers.

### Preferred
- Experience with custom hardware (ASIC, FPGA, advanced GPU scheduling) and emerging compute paradigms.
- Track record contributing to open-source infrastructure, standards, or industry benchmarking initiatives.
- Hands-on with large foundation model training/serving pipelines, distributed training frameworks, and inference acceleration.
- Familiarity with applied research cycles, technology scouting, and joint innovation labs with academia or vendors.
- Background leading multi-region modernization or cloud migration programs with complex regulatory constraints.

## Leadership & Influence
- Operates as technical “chief of staff” to engineering VPs/CTOs, guiding investment decisions and technical strategy.
- Mentors senior engineers across orgs, builds ladders, and calibrates promotion processes.
- Facilitates cross-functional alignment with product, security, finance, and operations to ensure initiatives land successfully.
- Champions engineering culture, postmortem rigor, learning programs, and inclusive technical communities.

## Certification & Education Patterns
- Advanced degrees in CS/EE or equivalent real-world accomplishments (publications, patents, open-source leadership).
- Specialized certifications are uncommon; more weight placed on demonstrated delivery of large-scale systems and performance wins.
- Executive communication and leadership training (e.g., storytelling workshops, negotiation) frequently supported by employers.
