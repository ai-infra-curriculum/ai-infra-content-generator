# Role Research Brief: AI Infrastructure Security Engineer

**Experience Level:** 8–13 years in security engineering with 4+ years focused on cloud/platform security; deep familiarity with ML/AI infrastructure, distributed systems, and DevSecOps practices. Often progresses from senior security engineer or SRE roles with specialization in AI/ML platforms.  
**Market Demand:** Accelerating across hyperscalers, foundation model companies, fintech, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Roles frequently sit within platform or security engineering orgs and partner tightly with MLOps, compliance, and SOC teams.  
**Salary Range (US 2025):**
- Min: $200,000
- Median: $260,000
- Max: $380,000+ (base), with total compensation $420k–$550k in top tech hubs.

## Core Responsibilities
- Design and implement zero-trust architectures, network segmentation, and identity strategies for ML training/serving infrastructure.
- Harden ML pipelines, data stores, and model artifacts against supply-chain, data poisoning, and adversarial threats.
- Lead secrets management, workload identity, policy-as-code, and guardrail automation across CI/CD and runtime.
- Build runtime security instrumentation (eBPF, agents, SIEM/SOAR integrations) and detection engineering for AI workloads.
- Automate compliance evidence, regulatory controls, and audit reporting for AI-specific frameworks.
- Partner with SOC, incident response, and threat intelligence teams to operationalize AI security monitoring and playbooks.
- Drive secure development practices with principal engineers, MLOps teams, and platform architects.
- Deliver executive updates, risk assessments, and security posture briefings; influence investment decisions.

## Technical & Strategic Skills
### Required
- Strong cloud/platform security foundations (identity/federation, network microsegmentation, secrets management).
- Expertise in DevSecOps automation (CI/CD hardening, policy-as-code, IaC security scanning).
- Experience with ML/AI security patterns: data/model protection, adversarial defense, secure multiparty/privacy tech.
- Runtime security tooling (SIEM, SOAR, EDR, eBPF) and integration with observability stacks.
- Scripting/automation proficiency (Python, Go, Terraform, Rego, policy frameworks).
- Operational excellence in incident response, postmortems, and chaos/security testing.
- Regulatory knowledge (SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, EU AI Act, sector-specific frameworks).

### Preferred
- Threat modeling and red teaming for ML systems; adversarial ML research exposure.
- Experience with confidential computing, secure enclaves, or privacy-preserving ML.
- Supply chain security tooling (SBOM, Sigstore, in-toto, SLSA) aligned to ML artifact pipelines.
- Involvement with security standards, open-source contributions, or industry working groups.
- Public speaking, whitepapers, or patents in AI security topics.

## Leadership & Influence
- Acts as technical security lead partnering with platform architects, compliance officers, and SOC managers.
- Coaches engineering teams on secure design, incident readiness, and compliance obligations.
- Shapes security roadmaps, investment cases, and cross-program coordination for AI initiatives.
- Bridges principal IC and leadership tracks by translating strategy into implementable controls.
