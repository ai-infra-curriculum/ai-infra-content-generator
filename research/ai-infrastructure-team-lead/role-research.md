# Role Research Brief: AI Infrastructure Team Lead

**Experience Level:** 8–12 years building and operating ML/AI infrastructure systems with 2–4 years leading technical teams or pods. Candidates often transition from senior or staff engineer roles and are expected to maintain hands-on credibility while scaling people leadership.  
**Market Demand:** High among hyperscalers, AI product companies, fintech, and enterprises rolling out AI platform teams. Team leads are critical bridges between principal ICs and engineering management for complex infrastructure programs.  
**Salary Range (US 2025):**
- Min: $190,000
- Median: $240,000
- Max: $320,000 (base), with total compensation frequently exceeding $400k in large tech firms.

## Core Responsibilities
- Lead day-to-day operations for AI infrastructure squads (on-call, incident response, platform reliability).
- Translate product and research requirements into actionable roadmaps, staffing plans, and execution cadences.
- Mentor and grow engineers (mid/senior/staff), aligning development plans with technical ladder expectations.
- Run cross-functional planning with product, research, platform, and security stakeholders; manage dependencies and trade-offs.
- Drive continuous improvement initiatives (process, tooling, automation) that improve delivery speed, quality, and developer experience.
- Communicate status, risks, and investment needs to directors/VPs; escalate issues with clear mitigation plans.
- Uphold culture of psychological safety, inclusive collaboration, and sustainable on-call practices.
- Contribute to hiring, performance reviews, and calibration decisions across engineering organizations.

## Technical & Leadership Skills
### Required
- Strong foundation in distributed systems, MLOps/platform tooling, and infrastructure automation (Kubernetes, IaC, CI/CD).
- Demonstrated incident management and operational leadership (SLOs, postmortems, observability tooling).
- Competence in project/program management (roadmaps, OKRs, risk registers, exec reporting).
- Mentorship and feedback excellence: ability to coach engineers across career stages.
- Cross-functional collaboration with product, research, security, and reliability teams.
- Data-driven decision making (metrics, dashboards, ROI analysis) for process improvements.
- High EQ communication: conflict management, stakeholder alignment, executive storytelling.

### Preferred
- Experience managing hybrid/principal IC reporting structures and matrixed teams.
- Exposure to regulated environments (finance, healthcare) requiring compliance coordination.
- Familiarity with performance/cost optimization initiatives for AI infrastructure (GPU fleet management, FinOps).
- Track record building inclusive culture programs, engineering guilds, or knowledge-sharing communities.
- Certifications or formal training in leadership, coaching, or project management (e.g., ICP-LEA, CCL, PMI-ACP).

## Leadership & Influence
- Acts as “technical manager” balancing hands-on knowledge with delegation and empowerment.
- Partners with principal ICs/architects for strategic direction while owning day-to-day execution.
- Leads cross-team rituals (standups, retrospectives, planning increments) and ensures visibility to executives.
- Shapes hiring, retention, and leveling decisions in partnership with HR/business partners.
