# Role Research – AI Infrastructure MLOps Engineer

## Mission Statement
Enable reliable, compliant, and observable ML delivery by connecting data science workflows with production infrastructure, automation, and governance.

## Key Responsibilities
- Design CI/CD pipelines purpose-built for ML training, validation, and deployment.
- Automate retraining, promotion, and rollback workflows using GitOps principles.
- Operate model monitoring, drift detection, and feedback loops in collaboration with SRE teams.
- Maintain model registries, artifact lineage, and approval workflows tied to compliance controls.
- Partner with platform engineering to deliver self-service tooling and developer experience improvements.
- Champion responsible AI practices, including audit trails, bias detection, and policy enforcement.

## Success Indicators
- MTTR for model incidents < 4 hours with clear rollback playbooks.
- Automated pipeline success rate > 95% across experiments and production runs.
- Drift detection coverage across priority models with documented response plans.
- Evidence packs for audits produced programmatically from pipelines.
- Cross-role adoption of shared automation templates (senior engineer, security, platform).

## Role Evolution & Dependencies
- Builds directly on Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer competencies (MOD-206, MOD-207) with a focus on ML lifecycle automation.
- Shares assets with AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer (feature store, orchestration, observability) to avoid duplication.
- Provides the operational backbone for architect-level initiatives (enterprise MLOps, responsible AI governance).
- Interfaces with security engineers to embed policy-as-code and threat modelling for ML systems.

## Risks & Constraints
- Tooling fragmentation across data science teams can slow standardization—curriculum highlights integration patterns.
- Regulatory expectations (financial services, healthcare) require strong governance; incorporate compliance modules early.
- LLM workloads introduce unpredictable cost/performance behavior—capstone emphasizes LLMOps guardrails.

## Research Artifacts Consulted
- Legacy repository docs (`ROLE_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `CURRICULUM.md`, project READMEs).
- Employer job descriptions (Databricks, Capital One, Spotify, JP Morgan) collected October 2025.
- Internal MLOps playbooks from senior engineer track (MOD-206) and architect enterprise MLOps program (PROJ-401).
