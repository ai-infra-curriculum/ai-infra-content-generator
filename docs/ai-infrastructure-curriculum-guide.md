## Phase 0 – Program Setup

1. **Clone the framework**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-content-generator.git
   cd ai-infra-content-generator
   ```

2. **Define repository strategy**
   - Copy `templates/curriculum/repository-strategy-template.yaml` to `curriculum/repository-strategy.yaml`.
   - Decide:
     - `repositories.mode`: `single_repo` if all roles share a mono-repo; `per_role` for separate repos.
     - `solutions.placement`: `inline` vs `separate`.
   - Fill in shared components (`shared_assets`) and progression rules to encourage reuse.

3. **Mirroring repositories**
   - Create (or reserve) GitHub repos that match the strategy (e.g., `ai-infra-platform-engineer`, `ai-infra-platform-engineer-solutions`).
   - For separate solutions repos, plan automation (Actions, scheduled sync job) now.

4. **Initialize workspaces for all 12 roles**

   **Core Infrastructure Track (3 roles):**

     python validation/completeness/check-module-completeness.py path/to/module
     # Project-specific checks (pytest, linting, bandit, etc.)
     ```

2. **Manual review**
   - Peer review modules, exercises, assessments, and solutions.
   - Ensure cross-role alignment (no duplicated text; advanced roles build on earlier ones).

3. **Security review**
   - Follow `SECURITY.md` best practices: scan dependencies, confirm secrets handled appropriately, etc.

4. **Changelog & release notes**
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with additions per release.
   - Create `RELEASE.md` or GitHub Release describing assets and status (draft/pilot/final).

5. **Publishing**
   - Push learning and solutions repos per strategy.
   - Tag release (e.g., `v0.3.0-ai-infra-curriculum`).
   - Communicate via Discussions or mailing list as appropriate.

Deliverables:
- `[ ]` QA report with resolved issues
- `[ ]` Updated changelog & release notes
- `[ ]` Published repositories/tags per strategy
- `[ ]` Announcement/discussion thread (optional)

## Operational Tips

- **Issue tracking**: Use the GitHub issue templates (bugs, features, documentation, templates/workflows) to coordinate workstreams.
- **Automation**: Set up GitHub Actions to run validation scripts on PRs and solutions repos.
- **Pipelines & CLI**: Inspect and execute manifests with `./tools/curriculum.py pipeline ai-infra-program`; embed steps in your orchestration tooling.
- **Metadata**: Store schema-compliant metadata alongside each asset and validate with `./tools/curriculum.py validate-metadata`.
- **Metrics**: Track progress in `curriculum/roles/multi-role-alignment.md` (e.g., status columns per module/project).
- **Review cadence**: Align with governance plan in `templates/curriculum/repository-strategy-template.yaml` (quarterly reviews, approvers).
- **Continuous improvement**: After each module/project release, document lessons learned in `CHANGELOG.md` or a dedicated `retrospectives/` folder.

## Appendix E: Estimated Effort

### Content Generation Time (AI-Assisted)

With content generator framework and AI assistance:

| Phase | Estimated Time | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 0: Setup | 2-4 hours | One-time workspace initialization |
| Phase 1: Research (all roles) | 24-36 hours | Job analysis, skills matrices for 12 roles |
| Phase 2: Curriculum Design | 36-48 hours | Master plans, module roadmaps for 12 roles |
| Phase 3: Learning Content | 200-300 hours | 100-120 modules, 12,000+ words each |
| Phase 4: Project Development | 80-120 hours | 45-55 projects with guides |
| Phase 5: Solutions Production | 120-180 hours | Complete implementations for all projects |
| Phase 6: QA & Publishing | 40-60 hours | Validation, testing, deployment |
| **TOTAL** | **502-748 hours** | ~12-18 weeks at 40 hrs/week |

### Manual Content Generation Time (Without AI)

Without automation, estimated time would be:
- **2,000-3,000 hours** (~12-18 months at 40 hrs/week)

**Time Savings: ~70-75% reduction with AI assistance and framework**
