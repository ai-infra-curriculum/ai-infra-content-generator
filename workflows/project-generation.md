## Phase 1: Project Planning (1-2 hours)

### Step 1: Define Project Scope

**Questions to Answer**:
1. What module(s) does this project reinforce?
2. What learning objectives does it validate?
3. What will learners build?
4. Why does this project matter (real-world relevance)?
5. What's the estimated completion time?

**Template**:
```markdown
## Project Scope

**Module**: [Module number and name]
**Learning Objectives Validated**:
- [Objective 1]
- [Objective 2]
- [Objective 3]

**Project Description**: [What learners will build]

**Real-World Relevance**: [Why this matters in production]

**Estimated Time**: [Hours to complete]

**Difficulty**: [Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
## Project Scope

**Module**: Module 5 - Docker Containerization

**Learning Objectives Validated**:
- Design and implement multi-container applications
- Create production-ready Dockerfiles
- Configure container networking and volumes
- Deploy containerized applications

**Project Description**:
Build a containerized microservices application consisting of a web frontend,
REST API backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache. Implement proper
networking, persistence, and monitoring.

**Real-World Relevance**:
This project mirrors how companies like Uber, Netflix, and Airbnb structure
their containerized applications. The patterns learned apply directly to
production deployments in any modern tech company.

**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

**Difficulty**: Intermediate
```

### Step 2: Identify Prerequisites

List what learners need before starting:

**Required Knowledge**:
- [Skill/concept 1]
- [Skill/concept 2]

**Completed Modules**:
- [Module X] - [Why needed]

**Development Environment**:
- [Tool 1] - [Version]
- [Tool 2] - [Version]

### Step 3: Design Learning Path

Break project into logical phases:

**Phase 1**: [Foundation]
- What: [Component to build]
- Time: [Estimate]
- Concepts: [What they'll learn]

**Phase 2**: [Next layer]
- Builds on: Phase 1
- What: [Next component]
- Concepts: [What they'll learn]

[Continue for all phases]

---

## Phase 2: Technical Design (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Architecture Design

**Create System Architecture**:
```
[Draw or describe the system architecture]

Example:
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Frontend  │─────▶│      API     │─────▶│  Database   │
│   (React)   │      │   (FastAPI)  │      │ (PostgreSQL)│
└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └─────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                     ┌──────────────┐
                     │    Cache     │
                     │   (Redis)    │
                     └──────────────┘
```

**Document Components**:
For each component:
- **Purpose**: What it does
- **Technology**: What it's built with
- **Interactions**: How it connects to others
- **Key Features**: What learners will implement

### Step 2: Define Project Structure

**Directory Layout**:
```
project-name/
├── README.md
├── docker-compose.yml
├── frontend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── src/
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── src/
├── database/
│   └── init.sql
└── docs/
    └── DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### Step 3: Identify Key Implementation Tasks

List specific tasks learners will complete:

**Task 1**: [Description]
- Files to create/modify: [List]
- Concepts demonstrated: [List]
- Success criteria: [How to verify]

**Example**:
```markdown
**Task 1**: Create Backend Dockerfile
- Files to create: `backend/Dockerfile`
- Concepts demonstrated:
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Layer caching optimization
  - Security (non-root user)
  - Health checks
- Success criteria:
  - Image builds successfully
  - Container starts and serves requests
  - Health check returns success
  - Image size < 200MB
```

### Step 4: Plan Extension Challenges

Add optional advanced challenges:

**Challenge 1**: [Advanced feature]
- What: [Description]
- Why: [Learning value]
- Difficulty: [Level]

---

## Phase 3: Create Starter Code (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Build Project Scaffold

Create minimal working structure:
- Directory structure
- Configuration files
- Placeholder files
- Basic README

**What to Include**:
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Configuration files (`.env.example`, etc.)
- [ ] Dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`)
- [ ] Docker files (commented templates)
- [ ] Basic README with setup instructions

**What NOT to Include**:
- Complete implementations (learners will build these)
- All code (provide scaffolding only)
- Solutions (these go in separate repo/branch)

### Step 2: Create Starter Files

**Example - Backend Dockerfile Template**:
```dockerfile
# TODO: Choose appropriate Python base image
FROM _______________

# TODO: Set working directory
WORKDIR _______________

# TODO: Copy dependency file
COPY _______________ .

# TODO: Install dependencies
RUN _______________

# TODO: Copy application code
COPY _______________ .

# TODO: Expose application port
EXPOSE _______________

# TODO: Define startup command
CMD _______________
```

**Example - API Route Template**:
```python
"""
User API endpoints.

TODO: Implement the following endpoints:
1. GET /users - List all users
2. GET /users/{id} - Get specific user
3. POST /users - Create new user
4. PUT /users/{id} - Update user
5. DELETE /users/{id} - Delete user

Each endpoint should:
- Validate input data
- Handle errors appropriately
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Log requests for debugging
"""

from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

router = APIRouter()

# TODO: Define Pydantic models for request/response


# TODO: Implement GET /users endpoint
@router.get("/users")
async def list_users():
    """List all users."""
    pass  # Your implementation here


# TODO: Implement GET /users/{id} endpoint


# TODO: Implement POST /users endpoint


# TODO: Implement PUT /users/{id} endpoint


# TODO: Implement DELETE /users/{id} endpoint
```
