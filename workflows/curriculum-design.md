## Phase 1: Market Research (20-40 hours)

### Step 1: Define Target Role

**Questions to Answer**:
1. What role is this curriculum preparing learners for?
2. What are typical titles for this role?
3. What's the career progression path?
4. What's the salary range?
5. What industries hire for this role?

**Research Sources**:
- Job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor)
- Company career pages
- Industry reports (Gartner, IDC)
- Professional associations
- Technical community forums

**Deliverable**: Role Definition Document
```markdown
## Target Role: [Role Name]

**Common Titles**:
- [Title 1]
- [Title 2]
- [Title 3]

**Career Level**: [Junior / Mid / Senior / Staff]

**Salary Range**: $[X]K - $[Y]K (US, 2025)

**Industries**:
- [Industry 1]
- [Industry 2]

**Career Progression**:
[Entry Role] → [Target Role] → [Next Role]

**Job Market**:
- Demand: [High / Medium / Low]

```

> **Template Support**: Copy `templates/research/role-research-template.md` to `research/<role-slug>/role-research.md` for each role you plan to support. Populate sections as you work through Phase 1.

### Step 2: Analyze Job Postings

Collect and analyze 20+ job postings:

**Data to Collect**:
```markdown
| Company | Location | Level | Required Skills | Preferred Skills | Education | Experience |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| [Co 1]  | [City]   | [Lvl] | [Skills]        | [Skills]         | [Degree]  | [Years]    |
```

**Analysis Questions**:
- Which skills appear in >80% of postings? (Core skills)
- Which skills appear in 40-80%? (Important skills)
- Which skills appear in <40%? (Nice-to-have skills)
- What tools/technologies are most common?
- What certifications are mentioned?
- What experience level is typical?

**Deliverable**: Skills Frequency Analysis
```markdown
## Skills Analysis (from 20 job postings)

**Core Skills** (>80% of postings):
- [Skill 1]: 95% (19/20 postings)
- [Skill 2]: 90% (18/20 postings)
- [Skill 3]: 85% (17/20 postings)

**Important Skills** (40-80%):
- [Skill 4]: 75% (15/20 postings)
- [Skill 5]: 65% (13/20 postings)

**Technologies**:
- [Tool 1]: 90%
- [Tool 2]: 75%
- [Tool 3]: 60%

**Experience Requirements**:
- 0-2 years: 30%
- 2-5 years: 50%
- 5+ years: 20%
```

> **Template Support**: Use `templates/research/job-posting-analysis-template.md` as the capture workbook. Store under `research/<role-slug>/job-posting-analysis.md` to keep evidence organized per role.

### Step 3: Interview Industry Practitioners

Conduct 5-10 informational interviews:

**Interview Questions**:
1. What does a typical day look like in your role?
2. What skills do you use most frequently?
3. What skills were hardest to learn?
4. What skills were surprisingly important?
5. What do you wish you'd learned earlier?
6. What trends are shaping the role?
7. What advice for someone entering this field?

**Deliverable**: Practitioner Insights Report
```markdown
## Insights from 7 Practitioners

**Most Used Skills** (mentioned by >50%):
- [Skill]: Mentioned by 6/7 (86%)
- [Skill]: Mentioned by 5/7 (71%)

**Hardest to Learn**:
- [Skill/Concept]
- [Skill/Concept]

**Surprisingly Important**:
- [Skill]: "I use this daily, but it wasn't in the job description"

**Career Advice**:
- [Key advice point 1]
- [Key advice point 2]

**Trends**:
- [Trend 1]: Impact on role
- [Trend 2]: New skills needed
```

> **Template Support**: Capture each conversation with `templates/research/practitioner-interview-template.md` (store under `research/<role-slug>/interviews/`). Summarize aggregate findings in this section.

### Step 4: Review Competing Curricula

Analyze 3-5 competing training programs:

**Programs to Review**:
- Online courses (Coursera, Udacity, Pluralsight)
- Bootcamps (coding bootcamps, etc.)
- University programs
- Corporate training programs
- Certification programs

**Analysis Framework**:
```markdown
## Program: [Name]

**Duration**: [Weeks/Months]
**Cost**: $[Amount]
**Format**: [Online/In-person/Hybrid]

**Modules Covered**:
1. [Module 1] - [Duration]
2. [Module 2] - [Duration]

**Strengths**:
- [What they do well]

**Gaps**:
- [What's missing]

**Differentiation Opportunity**:
- [How we can be better]
```

**Deliverable**: Competitive Analysis Report

### Step 5: Synthesize Skills Matrix

Combine insights from steps 1-4 to define competencies and proficiency expectations.

**Inputs**:
- Role research brief (`research/<role-slug>/role-research.md`)
- Job posting analysis (`research/<role-slug>/job-posting-analysis.md`)
- Practitioner interviews (`research/<role-slug>/interviews/`)
- Competitive analysis findings

**Process**:
1. Group recurring responsibilities into 3-5 competency domains.
2. For each competency, list observable skills and map to proficiency levels (Awareness → Expert).
3. Tag every statement with evidence sources (IDs like `JP-03`, `INT-01`).
4. Identify assessment modalities that verify each proficiency.

**Deliverable**: `research/<role-slug>/skills-matrix.yaml`

> **Template Support**: Use `prompts/research/skills-matrix-prompt.md` to draft the matrix, then refine it using `templates/research/skills-matrix-template.yaml`.

## Phase 2: Competency Framework (20-30 hours)

### Step 1: Define Core Competencies

Based on research, identify core competencies:

**Competency Template**:
```markdown
## Competency: [Name]

**Definition**: [What this competency means]

**Importance**: [Why it matters for the role]

**Proficiency Levels**:

```

> **Template Support**: Document the selected path in `curriculum/<role-slug>/master-plan.yaml` (copy from `templates/curriculum/master-plan-template.yaml`). For multi-role programs, leverage the `role_alignment_matrix` section to highlight shared and role-specific modules.

### Step 2: Design Each Module

For each module, specify:

**Module Specification Template**:
```markdown

### Step 3: Plan Projects

Design 3-4 major projects:

**Project Planning Template**:
```markdown
## Project [X]: [Title]

**Placement**: After Module [X]
**Duration**: [Hours]
**Difficulty**: [Level]

**Purpose**: [Why this project exists]

**What Learners Build**: [Description]

**Competencies Validated**:
- [Competency 1]
- [Competency 2]

**Technologies Used**:
- [Tech 1]
- [Tech 2]

**Deliverables**:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

**Portfolio Value**: [Why this matters for their portfolio]
```

**Deliverable**: Curriculum Architecture Document (20-30 pages)

### Step 4: Configure Solutions & Repository Strategy

1. Copy `templates/curriculum/repository-strategy-template.yaml` to `curriculum/repository-strategy.yaml` (if not already present).
2. Select repository mode:
   - `single_repo` when multiple roles share a mono-repo.
   - `per_role` when roles require their own repositories.
3. Decide solution placement (`inline` vs `separate`) and document destination paths for exercises, projects, and assessments.
4. Update each module roadmap (`Solutions Plan` section) with the chosen locations and note reuse across roles to prevent duplication.
5. Record cross-role progression and shared assets inside `curriculum/roles/multi-role-alignment.md`.
6. Align CI/CD and access policies (e.g., instructor-only solutions repos) with the chosen strategy.

**Deliverables**:
- `curriculum/repository-strategy.yaml` with program-specific values
- Multi-role alignment dashboard updated with repository and reuse decisions
