# Lecture 01 · Benchmark Architecture

## Objectives
- Design benchmarking systems that are reproducible, configurable, and automation-friendly.
- Select workloads, datasets, and metrics aligned with business outcomes.
- Establish data management practices for storing and comparing benchmark results across runs.

## Key Topics
1. **Benchmark Components** – workload selection, environment provisioning, measurement tooling, result storage.
2. **Reproducibility** – containerization, seed control, configuration management, dataset versioning.
3. **Parameter Management** – batch sizes, precision, concurrency, input distributions.
4. **Result Storage** – structured logging, metadata capture, retention policies.
5. **Integration** – hooking benchmarks into CI/CD, orchestration platforms, and dashboards.

## Activities
- Design a benchmark blueprint for a sample model, including workload, metrics, and environment configuration.
- Set up structured logging for benchmark runs and plan comparisons against baselines.
- Outline governance requirements (validation, retention) shared with MLOps and security teams.
