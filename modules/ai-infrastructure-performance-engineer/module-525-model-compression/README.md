# MOD-525 · Model Compression & Accuracy Management

Covers quantization, pruning, and distillation techniques along with validation workflows that preserve accuracy and responsible AI commitments.

## Learning Goals
- Execute compression strategies (INT8/FP8, GPTQ/AWQ, structured pruning, distillation) with automated evaluation.
- Manage accuracy, bias, and safety validation when deploying compressed models.
- Communicate performance/accuracy trade-offs and rollout plans to stakeholders.

## Cross-Role Integration
- Shares validation harnesses and responsible AI guardrails with MLOps and security modules.
- Provides compressed artifacts reused by ML Platform developer experience and architect FinOps analyses.
- Informs PROJ-521 pipeline optimization and PROJ-524 LLM efficiency programs.
