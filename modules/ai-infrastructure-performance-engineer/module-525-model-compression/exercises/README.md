# Exercises — MOD-525 Model Compression & Accuracy Management

1. **Quantization Lab** — Apply INT8/FP8 quantization to reference models using TensorRT/ONNX Runtime; measure accuracy and latency changes.
2. **Pruning & Distillation** — Implement structured pruning and knowledge distillation, tracking impact on performance and accuracy.
3. **Validation Automation** — Build automated evaluation harness that gates promotion based on accuracy/safety thresholds.
