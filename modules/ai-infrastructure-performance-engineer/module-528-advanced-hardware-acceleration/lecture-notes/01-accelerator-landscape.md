# Lecture 01 · Accelerator Landscape

## Objectives
- Compare capabilities of alternative accelerators (Inferentia, Trainium, TPU, Groq, custom ASICs) relative to GPU baselines.
- Understand software ecosystems, tooling maturity, and operational considerations for each hardware option.
- Identify workloads and business cases where non-GPU accelerators deliver clear ROI.

## Key Topics
1. **Hardware Overview** – architecture, precision support, memory bandwidth, networking.
2. **Software Ecosystems** – SDKs, compilers, framework support, community maturity.
3. **Deployment Models** – managed services vs on-prem, integration with Kubernetes/CI/CD.
4. **Case Studies** – success/failure stories, migration timelines, lessons learned.

## Activities
- Complete a comparison matrix scoring accelerators across performance, cost, ecosystem, and risk dimensions.
- Review vendor documentation and identify gaps requiring experimentation.
- Draft questions for vendor/partner discussions in preparation for feasibility study.
