# MOD-528 · Advanced Hardware & Compiler Acceleration

Explores specialized accelerators and compiler toolchains for pushing performance beyond commodity GPU deployments.

## Learning Goals
- Evaluate alternative accelerators (Inferentia, Trainium, TPUs, Groq, custom ASICs) for targeted ML workloads.
- Utilize compiler stacks (TVM, XLA, PyTorch Inductor, OpenAI Triton) to generate optimized kernels for diverse hardware.
- Build business cases and migration plans that consider performance, cost, and governance requirements.

## Cross-Role Integration
- Supplies feasibility studies and pilot assets for architect/principal modernization initiatives.
- Shares compiler insights with ML Platform and MLOps teams to coordinate tooling adoption.
- Ensures security/governance validation is considered when introducing new hardware.
