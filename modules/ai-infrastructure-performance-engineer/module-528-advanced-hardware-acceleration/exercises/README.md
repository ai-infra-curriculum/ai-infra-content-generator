# Exercises — MOD-528 Advanced Hardware & Compiler Acceleration

1. **Accelerator Porting Lab** — Port a reference model to an alternate accelerator (Inferentia/Trainium/TPU) and benchmark against GPU baseline.
2. **Compiler Optimization Workshop** — Use TVM, XLA, or PyTorch Inductor to generate optimized kernels; compare performance/accuracy across backends.
3. **Feasibility Assessment** — Create a mini feasibility report covering performance gains, cost implications, and validation requirements for adopting new hardware.
