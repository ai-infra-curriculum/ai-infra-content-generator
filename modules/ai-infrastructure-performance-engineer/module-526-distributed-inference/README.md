# MOD-526 · Distributed Inference & Scaling

Equips learners to design, deploy, and optimize multi-GPU/multi-node inference systems with continuous batching and autoscaling.

## Learning Goals
- Implement tensor/sequence/pipeline parallelism strategies using modern inference frameworks.
- Configure continuous batching, routing, and autoscaling policies tied to SLOs and cost targets.
- Instrument distributed systems for observability and incident response coordination.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-performance-learning/lessons/mod-006-distributed-inference`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Shares deployment and observability patterns with MLOps and ML Platform tracks to avoid redundant tooling.
- Provides performance data feeding FinOps reports for architect/principal programs.
- Coordinates with security/operations to ensure scaling changes include governance guardrails.
