# Solutions Placeholder — MOD-526 Distributed Inference & Scaling

Import from legacy solutions:
- `/home/claude/ai-infrastructure-project/repositories/solutions/ai-infra-performance-solutions/modules/mod-006-distributed-inference`

Expected artifacts:
- Deployment scripts/manifests for distributed inference stacks (TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, etc.).
- Continuous batching and autoscaling configurations with benchmarking results.
- Observability dashboards, chaos test scripts, and incident response runbooks.
