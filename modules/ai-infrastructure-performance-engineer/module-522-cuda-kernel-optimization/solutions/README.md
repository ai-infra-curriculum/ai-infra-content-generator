# Solutions Placeholder — MOD-522 CUDA & Kernel Optimization

Import from legacy solutions:
- `/home/claude/ai-infrastructure-project/repositories/solutions/ai-infra-performance-solutions/modules/mod-002-cuda-programming`

Expected artifacts:
- Custom CUDA/Triton kernel implementations with build scripts.
- Profiling reports demonstrating improvements and annotated Nsight captures.
- Automated tests and CI configuration for correctness and regression detection.
