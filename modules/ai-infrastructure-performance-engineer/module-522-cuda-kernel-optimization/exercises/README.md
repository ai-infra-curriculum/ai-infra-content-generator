# Exercises — MOD-522 CUDA & Kernel Optimization

1. **Kernel Profiling Lab** — Analyze baseline kernel performance, identify bottlenecks (memory, occupancy), and propose optimizations.
2. **Custom Kernel Implementation** — Write a fused CUDA/Triton kernel for a targeted operation (e.g., layernorm, attention) and integrate with PyTorch.
3. **Testing & Regression Automation** — Build automated tests (numerical accuracy, performance assertions) triggered by CI.
