# MOD-559 · Secure & Responsible MLOps

Implements defense-in-depth, threat mitigation, and responsible AI guardrails across ML pipelines, services, and governance workflows.

## Learning Goals
- Conduct threat modelling and risk assessments specific to ML systems and data pipelines.
- Integrate security controls, vulnerability scanning, and adversarial defenses into automation flows.
- Embed responsible AI guardrails (bias, explainability, human oversight) without disrupting delivery velocity.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/09-security`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Shares security artefacts with AI Infrastructure Security Engineer modules (MOD-901–910).
- Aligns responsible AI expectations with architect module MOD-605 and LLMOps capstone PROJ-555.
- Coordinates incident response with production ops module MOD-558 and governance module MOD-557.
