# MOD-554 · Data Quality & Lineage Automation

Automates validation and lineage capture across ML data pipelines to guarantee reproducibility, compliance, and trusted model performance.

## Learning Goals
- Embed schema, distribution, and anomaly checks into CI/CD and orchestration flows.
- Capture lineage metadata that feeds governance, platform, and architect dashboards.
- Produce audit-ready evidence packages without duplicating data engineering tooling.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/04-data-quality`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Reuses data validation patterns from engineer module MOD-105 and feature store governance (ML Platform MOD-504).
- Supplies evidence for governance module MOD-557 and architect compliance initiatives.
- Shares lineage data with security guardrails to avoid divergent policy implementations.
