# Lecture 01 · Experiment Metadata Design

## Objectives
- Define metadata standards (naming, tags, metrics) that enable automated governance and analytics.
- Connect experiment metadata to feature store entries and model registry records.
- Plan permissions, retention, and privacy considerations for experiment artefacts.

## Key Topics
1. **Metadata Schema** — parameters, datasets, metrics, environment details, approval status.
2. **Integration Points** — feature store IDs, model registry references, lineage identifiers.
3. **Automation Hooks** — CI/CD updates, promotion workflows, governance evidence captures.
4. **Security & Privacy** — access control, secrets, PII considerations, retention policies.
5. **Reporting** — dashboards, experimentation KPIs, portfolio views for leadership.

## Activities
- Design a metadata schema referencing legacy lesson guidance and shared templates.
- Implement sample tracking entries with automated tagging and approvals.
- Map metadata flows into governance and promotion pipelines for PROJ-553.
