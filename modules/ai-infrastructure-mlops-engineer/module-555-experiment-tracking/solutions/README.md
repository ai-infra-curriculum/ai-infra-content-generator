# Solutions Placeholder — MOD-555 Experiment Tracking & Reproducibility

Assets to migrate from `solutions/ai-infra-mlops-solutions`:
- MLflow/Weights & Biases project templates with automated metadata tagging.
- Reproducibility scripts (data snapshotting, environment packaging).
- Promotion review documentation and dashboards reused by governance project PROJ-554.
