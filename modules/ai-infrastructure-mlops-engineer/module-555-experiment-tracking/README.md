# MOD-555 · Experiment Tracking & Reproducibility

Standardizes experiment tracking, metadata capture, and promotion workflows to ensure reproducible, auditable model delivery across teams.

## Learning Goals
- Configure experiment tracking platforms with automated metadata and governance policies.
- Guarantee reproducibility by versioning data, code, environments, and configurations.
- Align experiment promotion with feature store and registry assets to avoid redundant tooling.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/05-experimentation`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Builds on senior experimentation maturity (MOD-206) and shares metadata with ML Platform feature store module MOD-504.
- Supplies artefacts to governance project PROJ-554 and architect enterprise MLOps initiative.
- Coordinates with responsible AI requirements introduced in MOD-559.
