# MOD-553 · Model Monitoring & Drift Response

Extends observability practices with model-centric metrics, drift detection, and incident response workflows that tie directly into automated retraining and governance gates.

## Learning Goals
- Instrument inference and training pipelines with actionable ML metrics, cost signals, and business KPIs.
- Automate drift detection, alerting, and response playbooks aligned with GitOps and orchestration flows.
- Share observability artefacts with platform and security teams to minimize duplicated tooling.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/03-model-monitoring`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Builds on Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer module MOD-207 (observability & SRE) to avoid reteaching fundamentals.
- Consumes shared dashboards from ML Platform module MOD-508 and security anomaly detection assets.
- Provides evidence feeds for governance module MOD-557 and LLMOps capstone PROJ-555.
