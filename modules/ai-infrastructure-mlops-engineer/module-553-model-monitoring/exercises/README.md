# Exercises — MOD-553 Model Monitoring & Drift Response

1. **Observability Stack Configuration** — Deploy Prometheus/Grafana dashboards using shared templates; add ML-specific metrics (latency, accuracy, data freshness).
2. **Drift Detection Pipeline** — Implement Evidently or Arize monitors triggered via CI/CD and orchestration, with automated retraining hooks.
3. **Incident Simulation** — Run a tabletop exercise using shared runbooks to practice detection, escalation, and postmortem workflows.
