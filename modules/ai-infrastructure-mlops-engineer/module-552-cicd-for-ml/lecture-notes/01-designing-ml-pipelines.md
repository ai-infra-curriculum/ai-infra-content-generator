# Lecture 01 · Designing ML Pipelines

## Objectives
- Compare ML pipeline requirements with traditional software delivery.
- Identify reusable components sourced from engineer/senior tracks to reduce rework.
- Plan promotion workflows with clear quality and governance gates.

## Key Topics
1. **Pipeline Stages** — data prep, training, evaluation, packaging, deployment, monitoring.
2. **Artifact Management** — models, datasets, metadata, registry integration.
3. **Shared Components** — Terraform modules, container build steps, security scans inherited from earlier roles.
4. **Promotion Strategies** — staging to production paths, approvals, rollback.
5. **Versioning & Traceability** — linking commits, data, and experiment metadata.

## Activities
- Review legacy pipelines to identify quick wins for templating.
- Map pipeline stages to shared components or templates across roles.
- Draft architecture diagram feeding into Project PROJ-551.
