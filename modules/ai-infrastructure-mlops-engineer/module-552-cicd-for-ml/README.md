# MOD-552 · CI/CD for Machine Learning

Implements ML-aware CI/CD and GitOps pipelines that standardize how models advance from experimentation to production.

## Learning Goals
- Build reusable pipeline templates covering data prep, training, validation, deployment, and rollback.
- Integrate automated testing, security scanning, and policy checks without slowing experimentation.
- Align pipeline architecture with ML Platform automation to maintain a single implementation pattern.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/02-cicd-for-ml`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Reuses infrastructure engineer pipeline assets (MOD-109) and senior automation lessons (MOD-206).
- Connects to ML Platform workflow orchestration (MOD-505) and governance module (MOD-557).
- Provides promotion artefacts consumed by compliance project PROJ-554.
