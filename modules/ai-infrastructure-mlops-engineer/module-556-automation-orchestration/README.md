# MOD-556 · Automation & Orchestration at Scale

Delivers resilient, reusable orchestration frameworks that unify automation across training, evaluation, deployment, and governance pipelines.

## Learning Goals
- Build modular DAGs and workflows using Airflow, Kubeflow, Prefect, and Argo Workflows.
- Embed reliability patterns (retries, compensation logic, chaos testing) and policy gates.
- Reuse shared automation assets from ML Platform module MOD-505 while tailoring for MLOps compliance.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/06-automation`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Extends senior automation practices (MOD-206) and leverages platform orchestration (MOD-505).
- Provides workflow components to governance project PROJ-554 and production ops module MOD-558.
- Aligns with security policy enforcement in MOD-559.
