# Lecture 01 · Lifecycle Overview

## Objectives
- Describe the ML lifecycle from ideation to operational sustainment.
- Highlight integration points with existing automation, observability, and governance assets.
- Identify stakeholders and communication cadences to support multi-role alignment.

## Key Topics
1. **Lifecycle Stages** — discovery, experimentation, training, validation, deployment, monitoring, improvement.
2. **Stakeholder Map** — data science, platform, security, compliance, product, SRE.
3. **Shared Artefacts** — runbooks, dashboards, governance evidence reused across roles.
4. **Anti-Patterns** — duplicated pipelines, manual approvals, siloed observability.
5. **Alignment Checklist** — confirm dependencies with senior engineer and ML Platform modules.

## Learning Activities
- Map current lifecycle using legacy documentation (`CURRICULUM.md`, `ROLE_REQUIREMENTS.md`).
- Tag lifecycle stages with existing assets (runbooks, automations) to find reuse opportunities.
- Draft lifecycle charter summarizing responsibilities and escalation paths.
