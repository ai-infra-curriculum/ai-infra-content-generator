# MOD-551 · MLOps Foundations

Establishes the operating model, vocabulary, and shared assets that connect data science experimentation with production-grade infrastructure.

## Learning Goals
- Define an end-to-end ML lifecycle and operating model spanning discovery, delivery, and sustainment.
- Inventory existing automation/observability/gov assets from junior, engineer, and senior tracks to avoid duplication.
- Prepare adoption, governance, and stakeholder alignment artefacts reused throughout the MLOps program.

## Legacy Source
- `learning/ai-infra-mlops-learning/lessons/01-mlops-foundations`

## Cross-Role Integration
- Builds directly on Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer module MOD-206 (advanced MLOps) for continuity.
- Feeds governance discussions in MOD-557 and LLMOps strategy in MOD-560.
- Shares stakeholder alignment outputs with ML Platform Module MOD-501 to maintain consistent framing.
