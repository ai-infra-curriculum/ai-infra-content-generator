# Exercise 3: ADRs Application

## Objective

Apply concepts from ADRs to solve a real-world architecture problem.

## Scenario

You are an AI Infrastructure Architect at a [company type]. The organization needs [specific requirement related to module topic].

**Context**:
- Current infrastructure: [description]
- Pain points: [list of issues]
- Goals: [list of objectives]
- Constraints: [budget, timeline, resources]

## Tasks

### Task 1: Analysis (30 minutes)

Analyze the current state and identify:
1. Key challenges and bottlenecks
2. Architectural gaps
3. Risk factors
4. Opportunities for improvement

**Deliverable**: Written analysis (1-2 pages)

### Task 2: Architecture Design (60 minutes)

Design an architecture solution that addresses the challenges:

1. **High-level architecture**:
   - Create component diagram
   - Define responsibilities of each component
   - Show interactions and data flows

2. **Key decisions**:
   - Technology selections with rationale
   - Design patterns applied
   - Trade-offs considered

3. **Non-functional requirements**:
   - Performance targets
   - Security measures
   - Cost estimates
   - Scalability approach

**Deliverable**: Architecture diagrams and design document (2-3 pages)

### Task 3: Implementation Plan (30 minutes)

Create an implementation roadmap:

1. **Phases**: Break work into phases (3-5)
2. **Timeline**: Estimated duration for each phase
3. **Dependencies**: What must happen first
4. **Risks**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Success metrics**: How to measure success

**Deliverable**: Implementation plan (1 page)

### Task 4: Stakeholder Communication (30 minutes)

Prepare a stakeholder presentation:

1. **Executive summary**: Key points in 1-2 slides
2. **Architecture overview**: Visual representation
3. **Business value**: Benefits and ROI
4. **Timeline and costs**: High-level estimates
5. **Risks and mitigation**: What could go wrong

**Deliverable**: Slide deck (5-7 slides)

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated on:

- **Architecture quality** (40%): Soundness of design, appropriate patterns
- **Documentation** (30%): Clarity, completeness, visual communication
- **Strategic thinking** (20%): Business alignment, long-term vision
- **Communication** (10%): Stakeholder-appropriate presentation

## Solution Approach

### Hints
1. Start by clearly defining requirements
2. Consider multiple architecture alternatives
3. Document your design decisions (ADRs)
4. Think about operational concerns (monitoring, maintenance)
5. Validate assumptions with research

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Over-engineering the solution
- ❌ Ignoring cost considerations
- ❌ Not addressing security and compliance
- ❌ Poor communication of trade-offs
- ❌ Lack of implementation roadmap

## Time Estimate

**Total**: 2.5 hours

- Analysis: 30 minutes
- Design: 60 minutes
- Planning: 30 minutes
- Communication: 30 minutes
