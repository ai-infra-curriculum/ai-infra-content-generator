2. **Create comprehensive architecture documentation** designing C4 diagrams (context, container, component, code), architecture decision records (ADRs), sequence diagrams, and deployment views communicating complex systems to diverse audiences

3. **Lead architecture review boards (ARB)** facilitating collaborative design reviews, evaluating proposals against standards, managing dissent, and building consensus across engineering, product, security, and executive stakeholders

4. **Design visual communication strategies** using diagrams, charts, dashboards, and presentations effectively tailoring visual complexity to audience technical sophistication maximizing comprehension and engagement

5. **Establish architecture governance frameworks** defining standards, review processes, exception handling, and escalation paths ensuring architectural consistency and quality across enterprise AI initiatives

6. **Influence without authority** building credibility through technical excellence, leveraging data and evidence, forming coalitions, and navigating organizational politics to drive architectural change

7. **Communicate technical risk** articulating security vulnerabilities, scalability concerns, technical debt, and architectural anti-patterns in business terms enabling informed decision-making by non-technical leaders

8. **Facilitate technical strategy sessions** conducting architecture workshops, leading design sprints, facilitating trade-off discussions, and building shared understanding across cross-functional teams

9. **Write compelling technical proposals** structuring RFCs (Request for Comments), architecture proposals, and technical strategy documents persuasively addressing business objectives, technical requirements, and implementation roadmaps

10. **Navigate organizational change** managing stakeholder resistance, communicating transformation roadmaps, celebrating wins, addressing concerns, and sustaining momentum for large-scale architecture modernization initiatives
