## Module Overview

Enterprise Security and Compliance Architecture is a critical component of the AI Infrastructure Architect curriculum, providing deep knowledge in Zero-Trust, GDPR, HIPAA, and more.

**Duration**: 55 hours

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Architect enterprise zero-trust security frameworks** implementing identity-based access, micro-segmentation, continuous verification, and least-privilege principles across distributed AI infrastructure eliminating implicit trust

2. **Design comprehensive compliance architectures** meeting SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP requirements implementing controls for data protection, audit trails, access governance, and regulatory reporting

3. **Establish data governance frameworks** implementing data classification, lineage tracking, privacy controls, and sovereignty compliance for AI/ML systems handling PII, PHI, and sensitive enterprise data across jurisdictions

4. **Implement privacy-preserving ML architectures** integrating differential privacy, federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation protecting individual privacy while enabling model training

5. **Design enterprise identity and access management (IAM)** architecting federated identity, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC) at scale

6. **Architect secure AI model deployment pipelines** implementing model signing, provenance tracking, vulnerability scanning, secrets management, and supply chain security preventing adversarial attacks and model poisoning

7. **Establish security operations centers (SOC)** for AI infrastructure implementing SIEM, threat detection, incident response, penetration testing, and red team exercises ensuring continuous security monitoring

8. **Design compliance automation frameworks** implementing policy-as-code, automated compliance checking, continuous auditing, and evidence collection reducing manual compliance burden and audit preparation time

9. **Implement data encryption strategies** architecting end-to-end encryption, key management systems (KMS), Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), and cryptographic controls for data at rest, in transit, and in use

10. **Lead enterprise security governance** establishing security architecture review boards, defining security standards, managing vulnerability remediation, conducting risk assessments, and reporting to board/executives on security posture
