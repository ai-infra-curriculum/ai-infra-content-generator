# Enterprise LLM Platform with RAG
## Executive Presentation

**Presented By**: AI Infrastructure Team
**Date**: January 2025
**Duration**: 30 minutes

---

## Slide 1: Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
Transform how our company leverages AI while reducing costs by 70%

### The Ask
**$8M investment over 2 years** to build enterprise LLM platform

### The Return
- **$64.6M net value** over 3 years
- **808% ROI**
- **11-month payback period**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Current State: Unsustainable

**Cost Crisis**:
- $6M/year on commercial LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude)
- Projected to reach $12M/year as adoption grows
- No cost visibility or control

**Data Privacy Risk**:
- Sensitive data sent to external APIs
- Cannot use AI for HIPAA/PCI-compliant data
- Compliance team blocking 40% of use cases

**Speed Bottleneck**:
- 20+ teams waiting for AI capabilities
- 6-month backlog for new use cases
- Competitive disadvantage (competitors shipping AI features 3x faster)

**Real Example**: Customer support team abandoned AI project after API bill hit $150K in one month

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Self-Hosted LLM Platform with RAG

**What We're Building**:
1. **Self-hosted open-source LLMs** (Llama 3 70B, Mistral 7B)
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate, grounded responses
3. **Hybrid approach**: Self-hosted for sensitive data, commercial APIs for complex tasks
4. **Safety guardrails**: PII detection, content moderation, compliance controls

**Why This Works**:
- 70% of queries can use self-hosted models (saving $4.2M/year)
- 30% still use GPT-4/Claude for complex reasoning
- Data stays on our infrastructure (compliance approved)
- 10x faster than commercial APIs (continuous batching, GPU optimization)

## Slide 9: Alternatives Considered

### Why Not Just Use Commercial APIs?

| Option | NPV | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|-----|------|------|----------|
| **Do Nothing** | -$36M | No upfront cost | Costs balloon to $12M/year | ❌ Rejected |
| **100% Commercial APIs** | -$8M | No infrastructure | $6M/year ongoing, data privacy issues | ❌ Rejected |
| **Buy SaaS Platform** | -$5M | Fast deployment | $3M/year licensing, vendor lock-in | ❌ Rejected |
| **Build Platform** (Recommended) | **+$52M** | Full control, data privacy, cost savings | Upfront investment, team required | ✅ **Recommended** |

**Why Build**:
- Only option that solves data privacy
- Only option with positive NPV
- Gives us competitive advantage (can't buy differentiation)

## Slide 15: Quotes from Pilot Teams

### What Teams Are Saying

> "We've been waiting 6 months for API approval. This platform would let us ship our AI support bot in 2 weeks."
> — **Sarah Chen, VP Customer Support**

> "The $150K surprise API bill killed our project. Self-hosted would give us predictable costs and let us experiment freely."
> — **Michael Rodriguez, Head of Data Science**

> "We can't use GPT-4 for medical data due to HIPAA. This platform would unlock AI for healthcare, our fastest-growing segment."
> — **Dr. Jennifer Kim, Chief Medical Officer**

> "Our competitors launched AI search last quarter. We're 6 months behind. We need to move faster."
> — **David Park, VP Product**

## Slide 16: The Bottom Line

### The Simple Case

**Without this platform**:
- Continue spending $6M/year (growing to $12M)
- Data privacy issues block 40% of use cases
- Competitors ship AI features 3x faster
- **3-year cost: $30M, zero strategic advantage**

**With this platform**:
- Invest $8M upfront
- Save $4.2M/year on LLM costs
- Enable $18M/year new revenue (AI products)
- Own our AI destiny
- **3-year value: $72.6M, competitive moat**

### The Strategic Imperative

**This isn't optional**. AI is becoming table stakes. The question isn't "Should we build a platform?" but "Can we afford not to?"

## Slide 17: Recommendation

### We Recommend Approval

**This project is**:
- ✅ **Strategically critical** (competitive necessity)
- ✅ **Financially sound** (808% ROI, 11-month payback)
- ✅ **Technically proven** (POC complete, open-source mature)
- ✅ **Risk-mitigated** (phased approach, go/no-go gates)

## Slide 18: Q&A

### Common Questions

**Q: Why not just wait for OpenAI to lower prices?**
A: They won't (costs are increasing with model size). And even if they did, data privacy is a blocker for 40% of our use cases.

**Q: What if open-source models don't keep up with GPT-5?**
A: Hybrid approach hedges this risk. We keep commercial APIs for complex tasks (30% of traffic).

**Q: Can we do this with fewer engineers?**
A: Not recommended. We need platform, ML, and security expertise. Cutting corners increases risk of failure.

**Q: What's the minimum viable version?**
A: Phase 1-2 ($4M, 6 months). Gets us to 5,000 users with basic RAG. But doesn't achieve full ROI.

**Q: What if adoption is lower than projected?**
A: Break-even is 3,000 active users. We have 5 pilot teams representing 8,000 users already committed.
