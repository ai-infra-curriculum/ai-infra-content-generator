## Slide 3: The Business Problem

### Current State: Manual, Slow, Risky

**Pain Points**:
1. **9-12 months** to deploy a single ML model
2. **$2-3M wasted annually** on failed ML projects
3. **Zero visibility** into model performance in production
4. **Compliance risks**: No governance framework for high-risk models
5. **Data scientists spend 70% of time on infrastructure**, not innovation

### Impact on Business
- Missed market opportunities (competitors ship faster)
- Customer churn from poor model performance
- Regulatory exposure (GDPR, HIPAA compliance gaps)
- Inefficient resource utilization (data scientists as DevOps engineers)

**Speaker Notes**: These numbers should resonate with CFO (wasted spend), CTO (speed), CEO (competitive risk), and Legal (compliance).

## Slide 14: Alternatives Considered

### Why Build vs. Buy?

| Option | Pros | Cons | 3-Year Cost | Decision |
|--------|------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Do Nothing** | $0 upfront | Status quo problems persist, competitive disadvantage | $10M (opportunity cost) | ❌ Rejected |
| **Buy Commercial (Databricks, SageMaker)** | Faster initial setup, vendor support | Vendor lock-in, limited customization, $50M cost | $50M | ❌ Too expensive |
| **Build Custom (Recommended)** | Full control, customization, cost-optimized | Upfront investment, requires talent | $35M | ✅ **Selected** |
| **Hybrid (Buy + Build)** | Balance of speed and control | Complexity, integration challenges | $42M | ❌ Not optimal |

### Why Custom Build Wins
1. **Cost**: 30% cheaper than commercial ($35M vs. $50M)
2. **Customization**: Tailored to our exact needs and workflows
3. **Control**: No vendor lock-in, we own the platform
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Our platform, our IP

**Speaker Notes**: You must address "why not buy?" CFO will ask this. Show that we did the analysis and custom build has the best ROI.

## Slide 15: Phased Approach & Decision Points

### Go/No-Go Gates Every 6 Months

**Gate 1 (Month 6): Foundation Complete**
- ✅ Core infrastructure deployed
- ✅ 2 pilot teams onboarded
- ✅ 10 models running in production
- **Decision**: Proceed to Phase 2 (Scale) or pivot?

**Gate 2 (Month 12): Scale Validation**
- ✅ 50+ models in production
- ✅ $500K+ cost savings realized
- ✅ 90%+ satisfaction score
- **Decision**: Proceed to Phase 3 (Optimize) or course-correct?

**Gate 3 (Month 18): Full Rollout**
- ✅ 100% adoption across data science teams
- ✅ $1M+ annual savings
- ✅ SOC 2 certified
- **Decision**: Continue investment or scale down?

### Exit Strategy
If adoption is poor or ROI doesn't materialize:
- **Month 6**: Can pivot to commercial solution ($15M sunk cost)
- **Month 12**: Can scale down and maintain current capacity ($25M sunk cost)
- **Month 18**: Can operate in maintenance mode, no new features

**Speaker Notes**: Show that this isn't all-or-nothing. We have checkpoints and can course-correct. This reduces perceived risk.

## Slide 18: Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions and Answers

**Q: Why can't we just use AWS SageMaker?**
A: SageMaker costs 40% more ($50M vs. $35M) and has vendor lock-in. Our custom platform gives us control and flexibility. We evaluated SageMaker thoroughly (see appendix).

**Q: What if we can't hire the talent?**
A: We have contingency plans: work with recruiting partners (Hired, TopTal), offer competitive compensation (top quartile), consider contractors initially. Worst case: pivot to managed solution at Month 6 gate.

**Q: How do we know data scientists will actually use this?**
A: We've surveyed 50+ data scientists - 85% said they'd use it if available. We're also implementing change management program with executive sponsorship. Success metrics include adoption rate.

**Q: What about security risks?**
A: Security is built-in from day 1: encryption everywhere, SOC 2 compliance, regular pen testing, defense-in-depth. We're following AWS Well-Architected Framework. CISO is involved in design.

**Q: Can we start smaller to reduce risk?**
A: Yes! Phase 1 is a 6-month pilot with 2 teams. We invest only $5M initially. If it fails, we pivot. This phased approach minimizes risk.

**Q: What happens if this fails?**
A: We have gates every 6 months to assess. We can pivot to commercial solution, scale down, or maintain current capacity. Maximum at-risk investment is $10M (Year 1), and even that delivers value via pilot.
