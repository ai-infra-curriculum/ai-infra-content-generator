## Financial Analysis

### Investment Required

**Year 1 - Initial Investment: $[X] million**

| Category | Amount | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Development** | $X.XM | Y FTEs × Z months × $W/year |
| **Infrastructure** | $X.XM | Cloud, hardware, networking |
| **Software Licenses** | $X.XM | Commercial tools, support contracts |
| **Migration/Integration** | $X.XM | Data migration, system integration |
| **Training** | $X.XM | Employee training, change management |
| **Program Management** | $X.XM | PM, architects, consultants |
| **Contingency (20%)** | $X.XM | Risk buffer |
| **Total Year 1** | **$X.XM** | |

**Years 2-3 - Ongoing Costs: $[Y] million/year**

| Category | Year 2 | Year 3 | Details |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Infrastructure | $X.XM | $X.XM | Cloud, hosting, storage |
| Operations Team | $X.XM | $X.XM | Support engineers |
| Software Licenses | $X.XM | $X.XM | Annual fees |
| Maintenance | $X.XM | $X.XM | Upgrades, patches |
| **Total/Year** | **$X.XM** | **$X.XM** | |

**3-Year Total Investment**: $[A]M + $[B]M + $[C]M = **$[Total]M**

### Value Creation

**Year 1 - Early Value: $[X] million**

| Value Category | Amount | Methodology |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Cost Savings** | $X.XM | [How calculated] |
| - Infrastructure optimization | $X.XM | 35% reduction × $current spend |
| - Process efficiency | $X.XM | [Calculation] |
| **Productivity Gains** | $X.XM | [How calculated] |
| - Faster time to market | $X.XM | [Calculation] |
| - Self-service enablement | $X.XM | [Calculation] |
| **Risk Reduction** | $X.XM | [How calculated] |
| - Avoided compliance fines | $X.XM | [Calculation] |
| - Prevented downtime | $X.XM | [Calculation] |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$X.XM** | |

**Year 2 - Scaled Value: $[Y] million**

[Same structure as Year 1, with increased benefits from full adoption]

**Year 3 - Mature Value: $[Z] million**

[Same structure, with mature platform benefits and potential new revenue]

**3-Year Total Value**: $[X]M + $[Y]M + $[Z]M = **$[Total]M**

### ROI Calculation

**Net Present Value (NPV)** - 10% discount rate:
```
PV of Benefits = $[Total Benefits] × discount factor = $X.XM
PV of Costs = $[Total Costs] × discount factor = $Y.XM
NPV = $X.XM - $Y.XM = $Z.XM
```

**Return on Investment (ROI)**:
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs
    = ($[Benefits]M - $[Costs]M) / $[Costs]M
    = X.X% over 3 years
    = Y.Y% annualized
```

**Payback Period**:
```
Cumulative by end of Year 2: $[Benefits]M benefits, $[Costs]M costs
Payback: ~XX months
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | Assumptions | NPV | ROI | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|-----|-----|----------------|
| **Best Case** | 20% higher benefits, 10% lower costs | $XXM | XX% | Strong approve |
| **Base Case** | As modeled above | $XXM | XX% | Approve |
| **Worst Case** | 20% lower benefits, 20% higher costs | $XXM | XX% | [Approve/Reconsider] |

**Break-Even Analysis**: Project remains positive even with [X]% reduction in benefits or [Y]% increase in costs.
