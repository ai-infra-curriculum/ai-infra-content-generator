# AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer - Solutions Repository

> **Status**: 🚧 **PLACEHOLDER - Content Coming Soon**

## Overview

This repository contains solution code, reference implementations, and completed exercises for the **AI Infrastructure ML Platform Engineer** learning track.

## What This Repository Will Contain

### Module Solutions
Solutions for all exercises focusing on ML platform development:
- Self-service ML platform implementations
- Multi-tenant ML infrastructure
- Model serving at scale (thousands of models)
- Platform APIs and SDKs for data scientists
- Resource quota and cost management systems
- Platform observability and SLOs
- Developer experience optimizations

### Reference Implementations
Production-grade platforms including:
- Complete ML platform architecture (model training, serving, monitoring)
- Multi-cloud ML platform deployment
- Internal ML platform (similar to Uber Michelangelo, Airbnb Bighead)
- Platform-as-a-Service for ML teams

### Code Quality Standards
All solutions will include:
- Platform API implementations (REST/gRPC)
- Multi-tenancy and isolation patterns
- Scalability tests (supporting 100+ teams)
- Cost attribution and chargeback systems
- Comprehensive platform documentation

## Prerequisites

Before using these solutions, you should have:
- Completed Engineer and MLOps tracks
- Experience with platform engineering
- Strong Kubernetes and cloud expertise
- Understanding of multi-tenancy patterns

## Learning Objectives

The ML Platform Engineer track prepares you to:
- Design and build complete ML platforms from scratch
- Enable hundreds of data scientists to deploy models independently
- Implement multi-tenant ML infrastructure with isolation
- Build platform APIs and SDKs for internal users
- Manage costs across teams with attribution and quotas
- Scale ML infrastructure to thousands of models
- Define and monitor platform SLOs

## Target Audience

This track is for:
- Platform engineers building ML infrastructure
- Senior MLOps engineers designing platforms
- Infrastructure architects for ML teams
- Engineers building internal ML tools

**Experience Level**: Advanced (4-6 years experience, 2+ years in ML infrastructure)

**Time Commitment**: 250-300 hours total
