# Housekeeping — MOD-522 CUDA & Kernel Optimization

- **Status:** Legacy repository lacks kernel source or profiling artifacts; need to add optimized kernels, benchmarks, and CI tests.
- **To-Do:**
  - Implement sample fused kernel(s) with build scripts.
  - Capture Nsight Compute reports showing performance gains.
  - Add automated correctness and regression tests (PyTorch/Triton) with CI instructions.
