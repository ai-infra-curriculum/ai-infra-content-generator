# MOD-522 Solutions — CUDA & Kernel Optimization

Legacy artefacts: `/home/claude/ai-infrastructure-project/repositories/solutions/ai-infra-performance-solutions/modules/mod-002-cuda-programming`

Expected migration tasks:
- Custom kernel source, build scripts, and integration examples.
- Profiling reports with annotated Nsight findings.
- Automated tests ensuring correctness and performance regression detection.
